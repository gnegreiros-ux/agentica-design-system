feature/[xx]  ← new feature

## Commit convention (Conventional Commits)

Format: `[type]([scope]): [short description]`

| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `feat` | New component or feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `token` | Token change (triggers mandatory review) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `a11y` | Accessibility improvement |
| `style` | Style change with no functional impact |
| `refactor` | Refactor with no behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or modifying tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |

### Valid examples
```
feat(button): add ghost variant with hover/focus states
fix(input): fix contrast ratio in error state (4.2 → 4.5)
token(semantic): add color.feedback.warning for alerts
docs(button): update the contract with escalation rules
a11y(modal): add focus trap and aria-modal handling
```

## Protection rules

**Current state (configured 2026-07-20, ADR-076):** `main` and `develop` both require
a PR (no direct push), the `lang-audit` status check green, and block force-push/branch
deletion — but **0 approving reviews required** on both, since `gnegreiros-ux` is
currently the repository's sole collaborator and GitHub cannot self-approve a PR.

**Target state once a second collaborator exists** (the rule this section originally
described, restore verbatim per ADR-076's trigger clause):
- `main`: merge only via PR + 2 approvals + green CI
- `develop`: merge only via PR + 1 approval + green CI

Other CI checks (`Playwright`, `build-and-deploy`) are not yet required checks — they
only trigger on `push` to `main` today, not on `pull_request` (see ADR-076). Making them
blocking pre-merge gates requires first adding a `pull_request` trigger to
`playwright.yml`, a separate decision not yet made.

- Any PR modifying `tokens/component.json` requires Principal Designer approval

## Rule for agents

An agent can:
- ✅ Create a `fix/` or `docs/` branch
- ✅ Make commits on a feature branch
- ✅ Open a PR with a complete description
- ❌ Merge a PR without human approval
- ❌ Push directly to `main` or `develop`
- ❌ Modify `tokens/component.json` without explicit approval
