## 0. Fundamental rule — Never a primitive token, never a hardcoded hex

> **This rule applies to ALL Figma code: components AND documentation pages.**

```
❌ FORBIDDEN — primitive token in a fill or stroke
   comp.fills = [{type:"SOLID", color:{r:0,g:0.478,b:0.408}}]
   frame.fills = [hexRgb("#007A68")]
   VARS["color/teal/500"]               ← primitive token

✅ REQUIRED — semantic token via vFill() with fallback
   comp.fills = vFill("color/action/primary", "#007A68")
   frame.fills = vFill("color/background/default", "#FFFFFF")
```

### Why

If a semantic token changes value (e.g. `color/action/primary` switches from teal to blue),
every Figma library update picks it up automatically. With hardcoded hex, nothing moves.
Primitives (`color/teal/500`) expose the implementation, not the intent — see `tokens-system.md`.

### Accepted exceptions

| Case | Reason | Required pattern |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| `gradientStops` | The Figma API doesn't support `setBoundVariableForPaint` on stops | Use the **semantic token's fallback hex** + comment `// token: color/...` |
| Opacity on decorative ellipse | Figma applies opacity on the node, not on the variable | `opacity:` on the node, `vFill()` for the color |

---

## 0bis. Mandatory audit — run `scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js` before ending ANY session that touched this file

> **Rule adopted 2026-07-23 (ADR-090)**, after a single verification request uncovered five
> regression classes (§26) that had been shipping silently for weeks — including ~1600 color
> bindings pointed at an orphaned variable collection, and hardcoded padding/radius drifted from
> the real code on `Button`'s 20 variants. `findOverflows()` alone (§21.A/§25) does not catch any
> of these — they need their own dedicated checks, and prose checklists get skipped under time
> pressure. A script does not get skipped the same way.

```
✅ Any session that calls use_figma with a mutation (fills, strokes, padding, radius, text,
   layout, new/moved/deleted nodes — anything that isn't a pure read) MUST run
   scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js against every page it touched before the session ends —
   not just before declaring the whole file "done"
✅ Fan out one use_figma call per touched page in a single message (skill's multi-page rule),
   paste the script's function bodies + a call to auditPage(page) in each
✅ If the audit returns anything in orphanedVariables, unboundComponentProps,
   brokenLineHeights, staleNameReferences, or brokenLinks, treat it as a blocking regression —
   fix it in the same session, don't defer
✅ clippedEffects and overflows entries are candidates to verify visually (§26.10 caveat), not
   automatic failures — check with a screenshot before deciding
❌ Never end a Figma session on "it looks right in the screenshot" alone — the orphaned-variable
   and hardcoded-padding bugs from 2026-07-23 both rendered PERFECTLY normally; only the audit
   script (or a human reading the properties panel) caught them
```

See §26 for the full incident writeups behind each check and §26.10 for what a clean result
looks like. See §26.9 specifically for renames/deletions — maintain `KNOWN_RENAMES` in
`scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js` the moment anything canonically named changes.

## 1. Component properties — when to use what

| Property | Figma type | When to use it |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Interactive state | **Variant** `State=` | Default, Hover, Focus, Disabled, Loading, Error, ReadOnly |
| Size | **Variant** `Size=` | sm / md / lg when dimensions actually change |
| Visual style | **Variant** `Variant=` | Primary / Secondary / Critical / Ghost |
| Optional sub-element | **Boolean** `HasIconLeft` | Show/hide icon, label, helper text, badge |
| Text content | **Text** `Label=` | Button label, placeholder, card title |
| Icon / avatar slot | **Instance Swap** `Icon=` | Swap an icon or avatar for another instance |

### Absolute rules

```
✅ Use Variant for anything that changes the visual structure (states, sizes)
✅ Use Boolean to toggle a sub-layer on/off (never a Variant for this)
✅ Name text layers identically across variants (e.g. "label")
   → Preserves text overrides when switching variants
✅ Document every component with a description in the properties panel
❌ Never create a Variant just to hide/show a layer → Boolean
❌ Never exceed 10 variants in a single ComponentSet (performance)
❌ Never nest more than 3 levels of components
```

---

## 2. Auto-layout — sizing rules

### Size modes

| Mode | When to use it | Example |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **HUG** (`AUTO`) | Component that grows with its content | Button, tag, badge |
| **FIXED** | Defined width/height (doc, grid, field) | Input 280 px, doc column |
| **FILL** (`layoutGrow=1`) | Child that fills available space | Text inside an input, flexible column |
| **Min/Max width** | Responsive component with constraints | Input min 120 px / max 480 px |

### Critical rule — resize() before primaryAxisSizingMode

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT — always in this order
frame.resize(width, 40);          // 1. resize FIRST
frame.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO"; // 2. AUTO after resize

// ❌ INCORRECT — figma silently reverts to FIXED (API bug)
frame.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
frame.resize(width, 40);
```

### Padding and gap

```
✅ Bind paddingLeft/paddingRight to space/control/padding-x
✅ Bind paddingTop/paddingBottom to space/control/padding-y
✅ Bind itemSpacing to space/control/gap (controls) or space/layout/component (sections)
✅ Use counterAxisAlignItems = "CENTER" for buttons and inline controls
❌ Never hardcode numeric values — always via bindV()
```

### Nested auto-layout

- A component can contain nested auto-layout frames (e.g. VERTICAL wrapper → HORIZONTAL field)
- Frames without auto-layout (`layoutMode = "NONE"`) allow absolute positioning of children
  → Use for internal controls: Toggle thumb, checkmark, radio dot

---

## 3. Component architecture

### Recommended model (atomic)

```
Level 0 — Primitives
  Icon/16  Icon/24  Avatar/xs  Avatar/md

Level 1 — Simple controls
  Toggle   Checkbox   Radio   Badge

Level 2 — Components
  Button (uses Icon/16)
  Input  (uses Icon/16)
  Select (uses Icon/16 + Badge)

Level 3 — Patterns
  FormField (uses Input + Label + HelperText)
  Toolbar   (uses Button + Toggle + Input)
```

```
✅ Create reusable base components before building composite components
✅ Nest instances (not copied frames) to preserve connections
✅ ONE logical component = ONE ComponentSet, with a Variant property for its
   style variations (Primary/Secondary/Critical/Ghost…) — never a separate
   ComponentSet per variation
❌ Never copy-paste a component's structure instead of nesting its instance
❌ Never duplicate variants to create "a slightly different version"
❌ Never create a separate ComponentSet per style variation (Button/Primary,
   Button/Secondary… as distinct sets) — see the incident below
```

### Structure of an Agentica ComponentSet — corrected rule (ADR 2026-07-06)

> **Incident.** This document's previous rule recommended "one ComponentSet per
> style variation" (`Button / Primary`, `Button / Secondary`… as 4 separate
> ComponentSets) to stay under 10 variants per set. That was a mistake: in Figma,
> each variation then became a **distinct component** — a designer building a
> mockup had to swap the entire instance to go from Primary to Secondary,
> instead of changing a single property. That is not how designers expect to
> work with a variant component (Material, Polaris, etc. all have just one
> Button component). Fixed on 2026-07-06: the 4 Button ComponentSets were
> merged into one with two properties (`Variant`, `State`).

**Correct pattern — ONE ComponentSet, two property axes:**

```
ComponentSet "Button"
  Variant=Primary,   State=Default/Hover/Focus/Disabled/Loading
  Variant=Secondary, State=Default/Hover/Focus/Disabled/Loading
  Variant=Critical,  State=Default/Hover/Focus/Disabled/Loading
  Variant=Ghost,     State=Default/Hover/Focus/Disabled        (Loading not applicable)
```

An incomplete grid (Ghost without Loading) is acceptable — not every combination
has to exist.

**Variant ceiling** — aligned with the `figma-generate-library` skill, not an
arbitrary cap of 10: the real cap is **30 combinations** (`Variant × State`, or
more if other axes are added) before splitting into a sub-component. Button at
19-20 variants stays well within this limit — there was never a reason to
split it.

**There is no "different structure" exception.** An earlier version of this
rule tolerated a separate ComponentSet if the families were "structurally
distinct" (e.g. Input `Search` with a built-in icon that `Text` doesn't have).
Fixed on 2026-07-06: in practice, `Input/Text` and `Input/Search` had been
built as 2 ComponentSets even though `Search` didn't even have a different
structure (just a different placeholder) — and even if the structure had
genuinely differed, the right solution is an **internal slot** (Boolean
`HasIcon` or Instance Swap `Icon=`) inside a single ComponentSet, not a
separate ComponentSet. One logical component = one ComponentSet, always —
structural variation is handled via a property (Boolean/Instance Swap), never
by duplicating the ComponentSet.

### ⚠️ API pitfall — merging components already attached to a ComponentSet

`figma.combineAsVariants()` on components that each belonged to a **distinct**
former ComponentSet produces a broken ComponentSet ("Component set has existing
errors" — `componentPropertyDefinitions` and `variantProperties` become
unreadable), even if the renaming appears to have worked. Each component keeps
an internal reference to its ex-ComponentSet's old property set, and Figma does
not silently reconcile them.

```
❌ FORBIDDEN
const old = [...setA.children, ...setB.children]; // components from DIFFERENT former sets
figma.combineAsVariants(old, page); // → broken, unreadable ComponentSet

✅ CORRECT — rebuild fresh components before merging
// 1. Read fills/strokes/text/layout from each old component (still readable)
// 2. figma.createComponent() for EACH variant, reproduce the visual, name it
//    correctly "Variant=X, State=Y" (fresh components = no leftover property history)
// 3. figma.combineAsVariants(newComponents, page) → clean ComponentSet
// 4. instance.swapComponent(newComponent) on every existing instance
//    BEFORE deleting the old components/ComponentSets
```

See the Button and Input incidents from 2026-07-06 — full recovery documented
in the GitHub Projects history (ADR-069). Same fix applied to both: Button (4
`Variant` ComponentSets → 1, 19 variants) and Input (2 `Type` ComponentSets →
1, 9 variants).

---

## 4. Naming

### Components and ComponentSets

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| ComponentSet | `Name / Variant` | `Button / Primary` |
| Variant property | `State=Value` | `State=Default` |
| Boolean property | PascalCase | `HasIconLeft`, `ShowHelper` |
| Text property | PascalCase | `Label`, `Placeholder` |

### Internal layers

```
✅ Name layers semantically and stably: "label", "field", "icon-left", "track", "thumb"
✅ Keep the SAME layer name across every variant of a ComponentSet
   → Preserves text overrides when switching state
✅ Prefix invisible layers with "_": "_focus-ring" (optional convention)
❌ Leave default names (Frame 47, Rectangle 2, Group 12)
```

### Figma pages

```
🎯 Brand          ← brand assets, never touch
🎨 Foundations    ← cover + sub-pages
  Foundations / Colors
  Foundations / Typography
  Foundations / Spacing
  Foundations / Logos
  Foundations / Icons
🧩 Components     ← catalog cover + sub-pages
  Components / Button
  Components / Input
  ...
📐 Patterns       ← flows, compositions, in-context examples
```

## 5. Binding Variables and Styles

### Mapping table — semantic token → fallback hex

> Every color used in components AND in documentation pages must come from
> this table. **Never a hex value outside this table.**

#### Action and brand colors

| Semantic token | Hex fallback | Primitive → | Usage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `color/action/primary` | `#007A68` | teal.11 | Main fill — button, link |
| `color/action/primary-hover` | `#0d3d38` | teal.12 | Hover / pressed state |
| `color/action/primary-subtle` | `#F0FAF8` | teal.2 | Description text on teal background (Header approach B) |

#### Text

| Semantic token | Hex fallback | Primitive → | Usage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `color/text/primary` | `#202020` | gray.12 | Body text, headings |
| `color/text/secondary` | `#646464` | gray.11 | Description, labels, helper text |
| `color/text/disabled` | `#767676` | neutral.500 | Placeholder, Disabled text |
| `color/text/on-action` | `#FFFFFF` | neutral.0 | Text on an action/primary background |

#### Backgrounds

| Semantic token | Hex fallback | Primitive → | Usage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `color/background/surface` | `#FFFFFF` | neutral.0 | Field background (Input), cards, white sections |
| `color/background/subtle` | `#f0f0f0` | gray.3 | Alternation, state cells, showcase background |
| `color/background/page` | `#fcfcfc` | gray.1 | page-wrapper background |
| `color/background/hover` | `#fafafa` | neutral.50 | Table row hover |

#### Feedback (DO / DON'T / error states)

| Semantic token | Hex fallback | Primitive → | Usage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `color/feedback/success` | `#18794e` | green.11 | DO badge, DO-column left border |
| `color/feedback/danger` | `#ce2c31` | red.11 | DON'T badge, error message, Error border |

#### Borders

| Semantic token | Hex fallback | Primitive → | Usage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `color/border/default` | `#e8e8e8` | gray.4 | Card stroke, table, Default field |
| `color/border/focus` | `#007A68` | teal.11 | 2px OUTSIDE focus ring — strokes |
| `color/border/danger` | `#ce2c31` | red.11 | Error field border |

---

### Fills and strokes

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT — semantic token + fallback (values from primitives.json)
comp.fills  = vFill("color/action/primary",      "#007A68"); // teal.11
frame.fills = vFill("color/background/surface",  "#FFFFFF"); // neutral.0
text.fills  = vFill("color/text/secondary",      "#646464"); // gray.11

// Strokes via setBoundVariableForPaint
comp.strokes = [figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(
  {type:"SOLID", color:hex("#006B5C")},
  "color",
  VARS["color/border/focus"]
)];

// ❌ FORBIDDEN
comp.fills = [{type:"SOLID", color:{r:0,g:0.478,b:0.408}}]; // raw hex
comp.fills = [{type:"SOLID", color:hexRgb("#007A68")}];      // raw hex
VARS["color/teal/500"]                                        // primitive token
```

### Float properties

```javascript
// ✅ Fallback value first, then bindV()
comp.paddingLeft = 16;
bindV(comp, 'paddingLeft', 'space/control/padding-x');
```

### Text

```javascript
// ✅ Required order to avoid Figma API errors
t.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Regular")}; // 1. font loaded
t.fontSize = 14;                                 // 2. default size
t.characters = "Label";                          // 3. content
t.textStyleId = TX["typography/label"].id;       // 4. style (overrides font)
t.fills = vFill("color/text/primary","#202020"); // 5. semantic token (gray.12)
```

### Exception — gradientStops (binding not supported by the API)

```javascript
// The only case where hex can appear directly
// → Use the semantic token's fallback + comment its name
{
  type: "GRADIENT_LINEAR",
  gradientTransform: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0.5]],
  gradientStops: [
    {position: 0, color: {r:1,   g:1,    b:1,    a:0}},  // color/background/default transparent
    {position: 1, color: {r:0,   g:0.478,b:0.408,a:0.14}}, // color/action/primary @ 14%
  ]
}
// ✅ The hex matches the semantic token's fallback — token referenced in a comment
```

### Variable scoping

- Define variables with the narrowest scope possible:
  - `color/text/*` → TEXT FILL scope
  - `color/background/*` → FRAME FILL scope
  - `color/border/*` → STROKE scope
  - `space/*` → GAP, PADDING scope
  - `radius/*` → CORNER RADIUS scope
- This keeps color/text variables from showing up in the frame background picker

---

## 6. Performance and scalability

```
✅ Maximum 10 variants per ComponentSet
✅ Maximum 3 levels of component nesting
✅ Split the library into files if > 200 components (Foundation lib / Component lib / Pattern lib)
✅ Use Shared Libraries to distribute components to other files
❌ Don't put every component in a single frame/page → lag
❌ Don't use a Group where an auto-layout Frame would be appropriate
❌ Don't create a "preview ComponentSet" with 100 instances → use dedicated doc pages
```

---

## 8. Component page layout

### Co-location rule — documentation on the same page as the component

> **Documentation (states, tokens, DO/DON'T, links) lives on the SAME Figma page as the component.**
> No separate "doc" page — a single `page-wrapper` holds everything.

```
Page "Components / Button"
  └── page-wrapper (VERTICAL auto-layout)
        ├── section-header      ← title, description, links
        ├── section-showcase    ← ComponentSets (the component itself)
        ├── section-states      ← state documentation
        ├── section-tokens      ← tokens used
        ├── section-dos-donts   ← best practices
        └── section-links       ← external references

Page "Patterns / Form"
  └── page-wrapper (same structure)
        ├── section-header
        ├── section-showcase    ← pattern in a real situation
        ├── section-anatomy     ← annotations
        ├── section-dos-donts
        └── section-links
```

Same for patterns. The `Components` catalog (35:7) only holds a **summary**;
the full documentation always lives on the dedicated page.

---

### Problem to avoid — overlap

Nodes created without explicit positioning all stack up at `x=0, y=0`.
**Solution: a VERTICAL auto-layout `page-wrapper` that holds everything.**

```javascript
// ✅ REQUIRED PATTERN — start of every component / pattern page
// All fills via vFill() — never hexRgb() directly (see section 0)
const wrapper = figma.createFrame();
wrapper.name = "page-wrapper";
wrapper.fills = vFill("color/background/page", "#F4F4F5");
wrapper.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
wrapper.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";       // height = content
wrapper.counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED";
wrapper.resize(1440, 800);                    // fixed width, height adjusted after
wrapper.itemSpacing = 0;                      // gap handled by sections
wrapper.paddingTop = 0; wrapper.paddingBottom = 0;
wrapper.paddingLeft = 0; wrapper.paddingRight = 0;
wrapper.clipsContent = false;
// All elements are appended to wrapper, not to figma.currentPage
```

### Section backgrounds — tokens and alternation

| Section | Semantic token | Hex fallback | Main text ratio |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| section-header | `color/background/default` | `#FFFFFF` | 16.4:1 ✅ |
| section-showcase | `color/background/subtle` | `#F4F4F5` | 14.9:1 ✅ |
| section-states | `color/background/default` | `#FFFFFF` | 16.4:1 ✅ |
| section-tokens | `color/background/subtle` | `#F4F4F5` | 14.9:1 ✅ |
| section-dos-donts | `color/background/default` | `#FFFFFF` | 16.4:1 ✅ |
| section-links | `color/background/subtle` | `#F4F4F5` | 14.9:1 ✅ |

```javascript
// Helper — always vFill() for the section background
function mkSection(name, bgToken, bgFallback) {
  const s = figma.createFrame();
  s.name = name;
  s.fills = vFill(bgToken, bgFallback);
  s.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
  s.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  s.counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED";
  s.resize(1440, 40);
  s.itemSpacing = 24;
  s.paddingTop = 60; s.paddingBottom = 60;
  s.paddingLeft = 80; s.paddingRight = 80;
  s.clipsContent = false;
  return s;
}

// Standard calls
const sHeader   = mkSection("section-header",    "color/background/default", "#FFFFFF");
const sShowcase = mkSection("section-showcase",  "color/background/subtle",  "#F4F4F5");
const sStates   = mkSection("section-states",    "color/background/default", "#FFFFFF");
const sTokens   = mkSection("section-tokens",    "color/background/subtle",  "#F4F4F5");
const sDos      = mkSection("section-dos-donts", "color/background/default", "#FFFFFF");
const sLinks    = mkSection("section-links",     "color/background/subtle",  "#F4F4F5");
```

### Wrapper positioning

```javascript
wrapper.x = 0;
wrapper.y = 0;
// Do NOT call figma.currentPage.appendChild(wrapper) — it attaches automatically
```

---

## 9. DO / DON'T template

**Rule: always include a DOs/DON'Ts section on every component page.**

The columns use a **white** background with a **colored left border** (4px) as the visual
signal. This choice guarantees minimum contrast on secondary text (description), which was
failing on a tinted background (4.48:1 < 4.5:1 required by WCAG AA). On a white background,
every text passes ≥ 6.4:1.

### Verified DO/DON'T palette

| Role | Hex | Background | WCAG ratio |
|------|-----|------|-----------|
| DO — left border | `#1B6E1B` | — | — |
| DO — badge text | `#1B6E1B` | `#FFFFFF` | **6.4:1** ✅ AA |
| DON'T — left border | `#B91C1C` | — | — |
| DON'T — badge text | `#B91C1C` | `#FFFFFF` | **6.5:1** ✅ AA |
| Example text | `#1C2024` | `#FFFFFF` | **16.4:1** ✅ AAA |
| Description text | `#4A5568` | `#FFFFFF` | **7.5:1** ✅ AA |

### Code pattern

```javascript
function mkDosSection(doExample, dontExample) {
  // Horizontal container with no fill of its own (background = parent section #FFFFFF)
  const row = figma.createFrame();
  row.name = "dos-row";
  row.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
  row.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  row.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  row.itemSpacing = 32;
  row.fills = [];

  function mkColumn(type, exampleText, description) {
    const col = figma.createFrame();
    col.name = type === "do" ? "do-column" : "dont-column";
    col.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
    col.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
    col.counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED";
    col.resize(560, 40);
    col.itemSpacing = 12;
    col.paddingTop = 20; col.paddingBottom = 20;
    col.paddingLeft = 20; col.paddingRight = 20;
    col.cornerRadius = 8;
    col.fills = vFill("color/background/default", "#FFFFFF"); // 16.4:1 ✅

    // Colored left border (4px) — semantic token depending on type
    const borderToken = type === "do" ? "color/feedback/success" : "color/feedback/error";
    const borderFallback = type === "do" ? "#1B6E1B" : "#B91C1C";
    col.strokes = [figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(
      {type:"SOLID", color:{r:borderFallback==="#1B6E1B"?0.106:0.725,
                            g:borderFallback==="#1B6E1B"?0.431:0.110,
                            b:borderFallback==="#1B6E1B"?0.106:0.110}},
      "color", VARS[borderToken]
    )];
    col.strokeWeight = 4;
    col.strokeAlign = "INSIDE";

    // DO / DON'T badge
    const badge = figma.createText();
    badge.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Semi Bold")};
    badge.fontSize = 12;
    badge.characters = type === "do" ? "✅  DO" : "❌  DON'T";
    badge.fills = vFill(borderToken, borderFallback); // 6.4:1 on white ✅
    col.appendChild(badge);

    // Example
    const example = figma.createText();
    example.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Regular")};
    example.fontSize = 14;
    example.characters = exampleText;
    example.fills = vFill("color/text/primary", "#1C2024"); // 16.4:1 ✅
    example.textAutoResize = "HEIGHT";
    col.appendChild(example);

    // Description
    const desc = figma.createText();
    desc.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Regular")};
    desc.fontSize = 13;
    desc.characters = description;
    desc.fills = vFill("color/text/secondary", "#4A5568"); // 7.5:1 ✅
    desc.textAutoResize = "HEIGHT";
    col.appendChild(desc);

    return col;
  }

  row.appendChild(mkColumn("do",   doExample.text,   doExample.desc));
  row.appendChild(mkColumn("dont", dontExample.text, dontExample.desc));
  return row;
}
```

### Integration into the section

```javascript
const sectionDos = mkSection("section-dos-donts", "#FFFFFF");

const dosLabel = figma.createText();
dosLabel.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Semi Bold")};
dosLabel.fontSize = 14;
dosLabel.characters = "Best practices";
dosLabel.fills = vFill("color/text/primary", "#1C2024");
sectionDos.appendChild(dosLabel);

const dosRow = mkDosSection(
  {text: "Permanently delete this folder",
   desc: "Explicit label — the user understands the action and its impact."},
  {text: "OK",
   desc: "Vague label — doesn't describe the critical action or its consequences."}
);
sectionDos.appendChild(dosRow);
wrapper.appendChild(sectionDos);
```

### Content rules

```
✅ White background for columns — never a tinted background (contrast issues confirmed)
✅ 4px colored left border as the signal — visible enough, not intrusive
✅ DO: show the right way to do it + a short justification
✅ DON'T: show the most common anti-pattern + its consequence
✅ Maximum 3 DO/DON'T pairs per page
❌ Green/red background: DO badge on #F0FCEF = 4.15:1 — FAILS WCAG AA
❌ Red background: description on #FFEFEF = 4.48:1 — FAILS WCAG AA (< 4.5:1)
```

## 10. Mandatory links

**Every component page must have a `links-row` — exactly once, in `section-links` at the bottom of the page.**

> History: this rule used to require a `links-row` in the header AND in
> `section-links`, which duplicated the same content twice on the page (fixed
> on 2026-07-06 — see §17 Known errors). The header now only contains the
> title and description; links live only at the bottom of the page.

### Verified link palette

| Role | Text hex | Background hex | WCAG ratio |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Link text | `#006B5C` | `#FFFFFF` | **6.5:1** ✅ AA |
| Link text | `#006B5C` | `#F4F4F5` | **5.9:1** ✅ AA |
| Pill border | `#006B5C` 40% | — | (decorative) |

> `#007A6A` on a tinted pill background (#E0ECEC) = **4.35:1 — FAIL** — replaced by `#006B5C` on a transparent background.

### Mandatory links

| Link | Source | Present when |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Guidelines | `guidelines/components/<comp>.md` (repo) | Always |
| NN/g | Relevant Nielsen Norman article | Always |
| WCAG | Applicable WCAG 2.1/2.2 criterion | If the component is interactive |
| ADR | `decisions/ADR-XXX.md` | If an ADR exists |
| Tokens | `tokens/component.json` (repo) | Always |

### Code pattern

```javascript
function mkLinksRow(links) {
  const row = figma.createFrame();
  row.name = "links-row";
  row.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
  row.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  row.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  row.itemSpacing = 12;
  row.fills = [];

  links.forEach(link => {
    const pill = figma.createFrame();
    pill.name = `link-${link.label.toLowerCase().replace(/\s/g,'-')}`;
    pill.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
    pill.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
    pill.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
    pill.itemSpacing = 4;
    pill.paddingTop = 6; pill.paddingBottom = 6;
    pill.paddingLeft = 12; pill.paddingRight = 12;
    pill.cornerRadius = 100;
    pill.fills = vFill("color/background/default", "#FFFFFF"); // 6.5:1 ✅ on white background
    pill.strokes = [figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(
      {type:"SOLID", color:{r:0, g:0.420, b:0.361}}, // #006B5C
      "color", VARS["color/border/focus"]
    )];
    pill.strokeWeight = 1;
    pill.strokeAlign = "INSIDE";

    const txt = figma.createText();
    txt.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Medium")};
    txt.fontSize = 12;
    txt.characters = `↗  ${link.label}`;
    txt.fills = vFill("color/border/focus", "#006B5C"); // 6.5:1 on white ✅
    txt.hyperlink = {type:"URL", value:link.url};
    pill.appendChild(txt);
    row.appendChild(pill);
  });
  return row;
}
```

### Typical call (Button example)

```javascript
const linksRow = mkLinksRow([
  {label:"Guidelines",     url:"https://github.com/orgs/agentica/docs/components/button.md"},
  {label:"NN/g — Buttons", url:"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/command-links/"},
  {label:"WCAG 1.3.5",     url:"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose"},
  {label:"ADR-042",        url:"https://github.com/orgs/agentica/decisions/ADR-042"},
  {label:"Tokens",         url:"https://github.com/orgs/agentica/tokens/component.json"},
]);
```

### Content rules

```
✅ White background on the pills (translucent tinted background = #007A6A on #E0ECEC = 4.35:1 — FAIL)
✅ Text #006B5C — 6.5:1 on white, 5.9:1 on zinc ✅ (vs #007A6A which fails on a tinted pill)
✅ Absolute URLs — never relative paths
✅ links-row only in section-links (bottom of page) — never also in section-header
❌ opacity on the whole pill — dilutes readability; put opacity on the pill frame, not the text
❌ Link to a Figma file (risk of a circular loop)
❌ Duplicate the same links-row in the header AND section-links
```

## 11. Accessibility palette — verified WCAG AA values

> All values below were computed using the WCAG 2.1 formula (relative luminance).
> Minimum required ratio: **4.5:1** for normal text (< 18pt / < 14pt bold).

### Text on page backgrounds

| Role | Text hex | Background hex | Ratio | WCAG |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|------|
| Heading (H1-H2) | `#1C2024` | `#FFFFFF` | 16.4:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Heading (H1-H2) | `#1C2024` | `#F4F4F5` | 14.9:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Body / label | `#1C2024` | `#FFFFFF` | 16.4:1 | ✅ AAA |

## 12. Decorations — Hero Gradient

### Decoration accessibility principle

> Any decoration that **touches** text must be checked for contrast.
> Decorative elements with no text on top of them can have any opacity.

Two approaches are defined — the choice is made at the page level:

| Approach | When to use it | Text |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **A — Partial** (recommended) | White header + teal as a right-side decoration | Dark (#1C2024) |
| **B — Bold** | Fully teal header — strong visual impact | White (#FFFFFF) |

---

### Approach A — Partial gradient (right-side decoration)

The header background stays white. The teal decoration is an absolutely positioned
overlay in the right half — **never underneath text**. All text stays on a white background.

```javascript
function mkHeaderSection(title, description) {
  const section = figma.createFrame();
  section.name = "section-header";
  section.fills = vFill("color/background/default", "#FFFFFF");
  section.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
  section.counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED";
  section.resize(1440, 40);
  section.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  section.itemSpacing = 20;
  section.paddingTop = 60; section.paddingBottom = 60;
  section.paddingLeft = 80; section.paddingRight = 80;
  section.clipsContent = true; // clip overflowing blobs

  // ── Absolute decorations ("_" prefix = non-content) ──────────────────

  // Right-side gradient (transparent → color/action/primary 14%)
  // Accepted exception (section 0): gradientStops don't support setBoundVariableForPaint
  // → semantic token's fallback hex + mandatory comment
  const decoGrad = figma.createFrame();
  decoGrad.name = "_deco-gradient";
  decoGrad.resize(800, 320);
  decoGrad.fills = [{
    type: "GRADIENT_LINEAR",
    gradientTransform: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0.5]], // left→right
    gradientStops: [
      {position:0,   color:{r:1,  g:1,    b:1,    a:0   }}, // color/background/default transparent
      {position:0.5, color:{r:0,  g:0.478,b:0.408,a:0.06}}, // color/action/primary 6%
      {position:1,   color:{r:0,  g:0.478,b:0.408,a:0.14}}, // color/action/primary 14%
    ]
  }];
  decoGrad.strokes = []; decoGrad.effects = [];
  decoGrad.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE";
  decoGrad.x = 640; decoGrad.y = 0;
  section.appendChild(decoGrad);

  // Large blob — color via vFill(), opacity via node.opacity (not on the fill)
  const blob1 = figma.createEllipse();
  blob1.name = "_deco-blob-lg";
  blob1.resize(340, 340);
  blob1.fills = vFill("color/action/primary", "#007A68");
  blob1.opacity = 0.07; // opacity on the node — section 0 exception
  blob1.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE";
  blob1.x = 1160; blob1.y = -120;
  section.appendChild(blob1);

  // Small secondary blob
  const blob2 = figma.createEllipse();
  blob2.name = "_deco-blob-sm";
  blob2.resize(180, 180);
  blob2.fills = vFill("color/action/primary", "#007A68");
  blob2.opacity = 0.05;
  blob2.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE";
  blob2.x = 1310; blob2.y = 100;
  section.appendChild(blob2);

  // ── Content (participates in auto-layout) ──────────────────────────────────

  const titleNode = figma.createText();
  titleNode.name = "component-title";
  titleNode.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Semi Bold")};
  titleNode.fontSize = 32;
  titleNode.characters = title;
  titleNode.fills = vFill("color/text/primary", "#1C2024"); // 16.4:1 ✅
  section.appendChild(titleNode);

  const descNode = figma.createText();
  descNode.name = "description";
  descNode.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Regular")};
  descNode.fontSize = 16;
  descNode.characters = description;
  descNode.fills = vFill("color/text/secondary", "#4A5568"); // 7.5:1 ✅
  descNode.textAutoResize = "HEIGHT";
  section.appendChild(descNode);

  // No links-row here — it lives only in section-links, at the bottom of the page (§10)

  return section;
}
```

**Contrast check — Approach A:**

| Text | Effective background | Ratio | WCAG |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| Title `#1C2024` | `#FFFFFF` | 16.4:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Description `#4A5568` | `#FFFFFF` | 7.5:1 | ✅ AA |
| Link `#006B5C` | `#FFFFFF` | 6.5:1 | ✅ AA |
| Teal background 14% max | No text on top | — | decorative ✅ |

---

### Approach B — Full teal gradient (white text)

The entire header is teal. Text switches to **white** — contrast checked.
Link pills become white pills with teal text.

```javascript
function mkHeaderSectionBold(title, description) {
  const section = figma.createFrame();
  section.name = "section-header";
  // Dark diagonal gradient → brand teal
  // gradientStops exception (section 0) — hex = fallback of the semantic tokens
  section.fills = [{
    type: "GRADIENT_LINEAR",
    gradientTransform: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]],
    gradientStops: [
      {position:0, color:{r:0,  g:0.353,b:0.294,a:1}}, // color/action/primary-hover #005A4E
      {position:1, color:{r:0,  g:0.478,b:0.408,a:1}}, // color/action/primary #007A68
    ]
  }];
  section.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
  section.counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED";
  section.resize(1440, 40);
  section.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  section.itemSpacing = 20;
  section.paddingTop = 60; section.paddingBottom = 60;
  section.paddingLeft = 80; section.paddingRight = 80;
  section.clipsContent = true;

  // Decorative blobs — color via vFill(), opacity via node.opacity
  const blobW1 = figma.createEllipse();
  blobW1.name = "_deco-blob-white-lg";
  blobW1.resize(400, 400);
  blobW1.fills = vFill("color/text/on-primary", "#FFFFFF"); // white
  blobW1.opacity = 0.06;
  blobW1.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE";
  blobW1.x = 1100; blobW1.y = -160;
  section.appendChild(blobW1);

  const blobW2 = figma.createEllipse();
  blobW2.name = "_deco-blob-white-sm";
  blobW2.resize(200, 200);
  blobW2.fills = vFill("color/text/on-primary", "#FFFFFF");
  blobW2.opacity = 0.04;
  blobW2.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE";
  blobW2.x = 1280; blobW2.y = 80;
  section.appendChild(blobW2);

  // White title — color/text/on-primary (5.27:1 min on #007A68 ✅)
  const titleNode = figma.createText();
  titleNode.name = "component-title";
  titleNode.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Semi Bold")};
  titleNode.fontSize = 32;
  titleNode.characters = title;
  titleNode.fills = vFill("color/text/on-primary", "#FFFFFF");
  section.appendChild(titleNode);

  // Description — slightly tinted color for visual hierarchy (4.95:1 ✅)
  const descNode = figma.createText();
  descNode.name = "description";
  descNode.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Regular")};
  descNode.fontSize = 16;
  descNode.characters = description;
  descNode.fills = vFill("color/action/primary-subtle", "#F0FAF8");
  descNode.textAutoResize = "HEIGHT";
  section.appendChild(descNode);

  // No links-row here — it lives only in section-links, at the bottom of the page (§10)
  // mkLinksRowOnDark stays available if a link pill is needed elsewhere on a teal background

  return section;
}

// mkLinksRow variant for a teal background (white pills, teal text)
function mkLinksRowOnDark(links) {
  const row = figma.createFrame();
  row.name = "links-row";
  row.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
  row.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  row.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  row.itemSpacing = 12;
  row.fills = [];
  links.forEach(link => {
    const pill = figma.createFrame();
    pill.name = `link-${link.label.toLowerCase().replace(/\s/g,'-')}`;
    pill.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
    pill.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO"; pill.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
    pill.itemSpacing = 4;
    pill.paddingTop = 6; pill.paddingBottom = 6;
    pill.paddingLeft = 12; pill.paddingRight = 12;
    pill.cornerRadius = 100;
    pill.fills = vFill("color/background/default", "#FFFFFF"); // white background — semantic token
    const txt = figma.createText();
    txt.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Medium")};
    txt.fontSize = 12;
    txt.characters = `↗  ${link.label}`;
    txt.fills = vFill("color/border/focus", "#006B5C"); // 6.5:1 on white ✅
    txt.hyperlink = {type:"URL", value:link.url};
    pill.appendChild(txt);
    row.appendChild(pill);
  });
  return row;
}
```

**Contrast check — Approach B:**

| Text | Effective background | Ratio | WCAG |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| White title | `#005A4B` (dark) | 8.2:1 | ✅ AAA |
| White title | `#007A68` (light) | 5.3:1 | ✅ AA |
| Description `#F0FAF8` | `#007A68` | 5.0:1 | ✅ AA |
| Teal link `#006B5C` | pill `#FFFFFF` | 6.5:1 | ✅ AA |

### section-showcase decoration — Subtle dots

```javascript
// Add a grid of dots to the section-showcase background
function addDotGrid(section, cols, rows) {
  const dotSize = 4, spacing = 24;
  for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
      const dot = figma.createEllipse();
      dot.name = "_dot";
      dot.resize(dotSize, dotSize);
      dot.fills = vFill("color/action/primary", "#007A68");
      dot.opacity = 0.12; // opacity on the node — section 0 exception
      dot.layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE";
      dot.x = c * spacing; dot.y = r * spacing;
      section.appendChild(dot);
    }
  }
}
// Call (20×8 = 160 dots over ~480×192px)
const showcase = mkSection("section-showcase", "#F4F4F5");
showcase.clipsContent = true;
addDotGrid(showcase, 20, 8);
// Then add the ComponentSets into showcase (they render above)
```

---

### Decoration rules

```
✅ Prefix decorative layers with "_": _deco-gradient, _deco-blob-lg
✅ layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE" on every decorative element
✅ section.clipsContent = true when decorations overflow
✅ Max opacity: 14% for decorative fills (preserves contrast)
✅ No text on an unverified tinted background
❌ Don't put text inside _deco-* frames
❌ Opacity > 20% for decorations (risk to adjacent text)
❌ Blobs / gradients in section-states, section-tokens, section-dos-donts
   → these sections stay pure white or zinc to maximize readability
```

## 13. Canvas background — the #535353 rule

> **Every Figma page (except Brand) must have a `#535353` canvas background.**
> This rule applies to every new page and every build script.

```javascript
// ✅ REQUIRED — run on every page (except Brand 17:4)
function h2r(hex) {
  const r = parseInt(hex.slice(1,3),16)/255;
  const g = parseInt(hex.slice(3,5),16)/255;
  const b = parseInt(hex.slice(5,7),16)/255;
  return {r,g,b};
}
const BG_CANVAS = h2r("#535353");
figma.currentPage.backgrounds = [{type:"SOLID", color:BG_CANVAS}];
```

### Why `#535353`

This neutral gray creates enough contrast against white and subtle frames (#FCFCFC, #F4F4F5)
without "swallowing" dark components — it simulates the production environment (a neutral web page background).

### Exception

- **Brand (page 17:4)**: has its own brand-specific background, never touch it.
- The frames *themselves* keep their own tokens — only `page.backgrounds` changes.

### Automated check in a script

```javascript
const bgTarget = h2r("#535353");
const pages = figma.root.children;
pages.forEach(page => {
  if (page.id === "17:4") return; // Brand — skip
  const current = page.backgrounds[0];
  const needsFix = !current || current.type !== "SOLID"
    || Math.abs(current.color.r - bgTarget.r) > 0.005
    || Math.abs(current.color.g - bgTarget.g) > 0.005
    || Math.abs(current.color.b - bgTarget.b) > 0.005;
  if (needsFix) page.backgrounds = [{type:"SOLID", color:bgTarget}];
});
```

## 14. Agentica font — Atkinson Hyperlegible

> **Inter has been replaced by Atkinson Hyperlegible since 2026-06-09 (ADR-021).**
> All new code must use AH. Global-fix scripts rely on `ahStyle()`.

### Weight availability

| Requested weight | Weight used | Reason |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Regular | Regular | Direct |
| Medium | **Regular** | AH has no Medium (ADR-021: fontWeight.medium=500 → 400) |
| Semi Bold | **Bold** | AH has no Semi Bold |
| Bold | Bold | Direct |
| Extra Bold / Black / Heavy | **Bold** | AH only has 2 weights |

### Mandatory helper

```javascript
function ahStyle(s) {
  const bold = ["Bold","Semi Bold","Extra Bold","ExtraBold","Black","Heavy"];
  return bold.includes(s) ? "Bold" : "Regular";
}

// mkT — FILL text inside a container (natural wrap)
function mkT(chars, style, size, tok, fb) {
  const t = figma.createText();
  t.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle(style||"Regular")};
  t.fontSize = size||14; t.characters = String(chars);
  t.fills = vFill(tok||"color/text/primary", fb||"#202020");
  t.textAutoResize = "HEIGHT"; return t;
}

// mkI — inline text (pills, titles, badges) — natural width
function mkI(chars, style, size, tok, fb) {
  const t = figma.createText();
  t.fontName = {family:"Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle(style||"Regular")};
  t.fontSize = size||14; t.characters = String(chars);
  t.fills = vFill(tok||"color/text/primary", fb||"#202020");
  t.textAutoResize = "WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT"; return t;
}
```

### Monospace font

`Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono` only for code blocks (`<code>`, `<pre>`).
Never for running text.

### Required installation

Both fonts must be installed **locally** for the Figma plugin to load them:
- `Atkinson Hyperlegible` (Regular + Bold)
- `Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono` (Regular)

---

## 15. ComponentSet showcase — instance approach

> **Never insert a ComponentSet directly into the page layout flow.**
> Variants position themselves at `(0,0)` → guaranteed overlap.

### Rule

1. Move the ComponentSet to `y = 3000` (out of the flow, still accessible to the library)
2. Create an `instances-row` WRAP auto-layout
3. For each variant: `variant.createInstance()` inside a VERTICAL wrap with a label
4. After `sSection.appendChild(instRow)`: `instRow.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL"`

```javascript
// ComponentSet → y=3000
compSets.forEach(cs => { cs.x = 0; cs.y = 3000; });

// instances-row WRAP
const instRow = figma.createFrame();
instRow.name = "instances-row";
instRow.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
instRow.layoutWrap = "WRAP";
instRow.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
instRow.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
bv(instRow, "itemSpacing", "space/layout/component", 20);
bv(instRow, "counterAxisSpacing", "space/layout/component", 20);
instRow.fills = [];

compSets.forEach(cs => {
  [...cs.children].forEach(variant => {
    try {
      const wrap = figma.createFrame();
      wrap.name = variant.name;
      wrap.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
      wrap.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
      wrap.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
      bv(wrap, "itemSpacing", "space/control/gap", 8);
      wrap.fills = [];
      wrap.appendChild(variant.createInstance());
      const lbl = mkI(
        variant.name.replace(/State=/,""), "Regular", 11,

      );
      lbl.letterSpacing = {value:0.3, unit:"PIXELS"};
      wrap.appendChild(lbl);
      instRow.appendChild(wrap);
    } catch(e) {}
  });
});

sSection.appendChild(instRow);
instRow.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL"; // constrain to the section's width
```

## 16. "Main component" frame — mandatory rule

> **Every ComponentSet (or isolated Component) must live inside a frame named `Main component`,
> positioned at `x = 1600, y = 0` on its page.**

### Structure

```
Frame "Main component"   x=1600, y=0
  VERTICAL auto-layout · padding 24px · gap 32px
  background #FAFAFA · border #E8E8E8 1px · cornerRadius 8
  ├── section "button-/-primary"
  │   ├── Title (Bold 12px, #202020)  "Button / Primary"
  │   ├── Variants (Regular 10px, #646464)  "Default · Hover · Focus · Disabled · Loading"
  │   └── ComponentSet  (FIXED sizing — keeps its native dimensions)
  ├── section "button-/-secondary"
  │   └── ...
  └── (one section per ComponentSet)
```

### Rules

```
✅ x=1600, y=0 on every component page
✅ Only one "Main component" frame per page (delete the old one before recreating it)
✅ Each section: bold title + list of states as a subtitle + the ComponentSet
✅ layoutSizingHorizontal = "FIXED" on every ComponentSet (keeps its native width)
✅ Also applies to isolated Components (e.g. Checkbox's Focus/Disabled variants)
❌ Never leave a ComponentSet floating directly on the canvas
❌ Never rename ComponentSets while moving them into the frame
```

### Code pattern

```javascript
async function mkMainComponent(sets) {
  // sets = [{ node: ComponentSetNode, label: "Button / Primary", variants: "Default · Hover…" }]

  const existing = figma.currentPage.findChildren(n => n.name === "Main component");
  existing.forEach(e => e.remove());

  const frame = figma.createFrame();
  frame.name = "Main component";
  frame.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
  frame.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  frame.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
  frame.itemSpacing = 32;
  frame.paddingTop = 24; frame.paddingBottom = 24;
  frame.paddingLeft = 24; frame.paddingRight = 24;
  frame.cornerRadius = 8;
  frame.fills = vFill("color/background/hover", "#FAFAFA");
  frame.strokes = [figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(
    {type:"SOLID", color:hex("#E8E8E8")},
    "color",
    VARS["color/border/default"]
  )];
  frame.strokeWeight = 1; frame.strokeAlign = "INSIDE";
  frame.x = 1600; frame.y = 0;

  for (const { node, label, variants } of sets) {
    const section = figma.createFrame();
    section.name = label.replace(/\s*\/\s*/g, "-").toLowerCase();
    section.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
    section.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
    section.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
    section.itemSpacing = 6;
    section.fills = [];

    const titleNode = figma.createText();
    titleNode.fontName = { family: "Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Bold") };
    titleNode.fontSize = 12; titleNode.characters = label;
    titleNode.fills = vFill("color/text/primary", "#202020");
    titleNode.textAutoResize = "WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT";
    section.appendChild(titleNode);

    const varNode = figma.createText();
    varNode.fontName = { family: "Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: ahStyle("Regular") };
    varNode.fontSize = 10; varNode.characters = variants;
    varNode.fills = vFill("color/text/secondary", "#646464");
    varNode.textAutoResize = "WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT";
    section.appendChild(varNode);

    section.appendChild(node);
    try { node.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FIXED"; } catch(e) {}
    try { node.layoutSizingVertical = "FIXED"; } catch(e) {}

    frame.appendChild(section);
  }
  return frame;
}
```

## 17. Rows with a variable item count — WRAP + FILL mandatory

> **Any row whose item count depends on the component (`states-row`, `instances-row`,
> or equivalent) must have `layoutWrap="WRAP"` AND `layoutSizingHorizontal="FILL"`.**
> 2026-07-06 incident: Input's `states-row` (6 states: Default, Focused, Filled,
> Error, Disabled, ReadOnly) was 1560px inside a 1440px section — it visually
> overflowed the page (visible on the last state, "ReadOnly", clipped by the
> canvas edge). §15 already documented this fix for `instances-row`, but didn't
> generalize it to `states-row` — the omission recurred elsewhere from simply
> copy-pasting the non-WRAP pattern.

### Why `layoutWrap="WRAP"` alone isn't enough

```javascript
// ❌ INSUFFICIENT — WRAP with no width constraint does NOTHING
row.layoutWrap = "WRAP";
// The row is HUG-sized (width = sum of children): there's never an edge to
// reach, so it never wraps to a new line. It silently overflows the parent section.

// ✅ CORRECT — WRAP + FILL (the row must be a child of an auto-layout parent)
row.layoutWrap = "WRAP";
row.counterAxisSpacing = 16;         // vertical gap between wrapped lines
row.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL"; // constrains the row to the parent's width → forces the wrap
```

### Systematic verification rule

Before considering a component page done, for **every horizontal row** (states,
instances, or any list whose size depends on the component's variants):

```
✅ layoutWrap = "WRAP"
✅ layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL" (never left as HUG/AUTO)
✅ counterAxisSpacing defined (otherwise wrapped lines touch each other)
✅ Verify with get_screenshot that nothing extends past the section's white background
   (content overflowing onto the #535353 canvas gray = overflow signal)
❌ Never assume a component with few variants will always stay on a single line
   — the number of states (Input has 6, most have 4) varies per component
❌ Never tolerate a "minor" overflow (a few pixels) on the grounds that it's
   imperceptible — apply WRAP+FILL systematically, with no tolerance threshold
```

> **2026-07-06 incident (again) — Segmented.** The COMPONENT section's
> `instances-row` overflowed by 2px (1442px inside a 1440px section). Left as-is
> at first, judged "negligible." Fixed after an explicit request: always prefer
> an extra line (WRAP) over any overflow, however small — there is no acceptable
> threshold. Once WRAP+FILL is applied, the multi-line rendering stays clean
> (each `Tabs=N` naturally gets its own line) — the argument "it would break a
> clean layout" never justifies keeping an overflow.

---

## 18. Always the component token — never the semantic one directly

> **2026-07-06 incident.** Button, Input, Toggle, Checkbox, Radio, and Segmented bound
> their fills/strokes/text directly to variables from the `semantic` collection
> (e.g. `semantic/color/action/primary`), even though the `component` collection
> exists and defines dedicated tokens per component (e.g. `component/button/primary/background`).
> This is the exact Figma equivalent of the `tokens-system.md` level-3 rule —
> violated on both sides (Figma **and** `agtc-button.js`'s CSS, which also
> referenced the semantic token directly before the fix).

### Rule

```
✅ Before binding a fill/stroke/text, check whether a component/<comp>/... token exists
✅ If yes → use it, never the semantic/... it references internally
✅ If not (a state not covered by tokens/component.json, e.g. Disabled on most
   components) → stay on semantic/... explicitly, that's not a mistake
❌ Never bind a semantic/... when an equivalent component/... exists
❌ Never invent a component/... token that doesn't exist in tokens/component.json
   without adding it there first (the JSON is the source of truth, Figma follows — never the reverse)
```

### How to check whether a component token exists

```javascript
// List every token in the "component" collection for a given component
const collections = await figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync();
const comp = collections.find(c => c.name === 'component');
const vars = await Promise.all(comp.variableIds.map(id => figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(id)));
vars.filter(v => v.name.startsWith('button/')).map(v => v.name);
```

The "TOKENS USED" table on each component page must list the **component** tokens
actually bound — not the semantic tokens they reference internally (except for
properties with no dedicated component token, where the semantic token is
correct and should be shown as-is).

---

## 19. Always `textStyleId` — never manual fontName/fontSize that "match" a style

> **2026-07-06 incident.** Component text used the right font and the right size
> (e.g. 14px Regular = values identical to `typography/label`) but wasn't
> **bound** to the library's Text Style via `textStyleId`. Result: if the
> library's typography changes, this text doesn't follow along — it only
> resembled the style at the moment it was created.

### Rule

```
✅ Always set text.textStyleId = <the library Text Style's id>
❌ Never settle for fontName + fontSize + lineHeight that manually reproduce
   an existing Text Style's values — that is not a binding
```

### ⚠️ API pitfall — `textStyleId` + a weight different from the style = broken link

`textNode.textStyleId = style.id` works. But any font mutation **afterward**
(`textNode.fontName = {...}` OR `textNode.setRangeFontName(...)`) silently
clears `textStyleId` (it reverts to `""`) — unlike the Figma editor, where
changing the weight on styled text leaves a partial "override" indicator. The
Plugin API doesn't support this partial behavior: it's all or nothing.

```javascript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN — clears the link
textNode.textStyleId = labelStyle.id;
textNode.fontName = { family: "Atkinson Hyperlegible", style: "Bold" }; // → textStyleId reverts to ""

// ✅ CORRECT — if the required weight differs from the existing style, create the right style
// (see the Button incident: typography/label is Regular, the button's text is Bold
//  → typography/label-bold created, a full Text Style in its own right, native Bold)
textNode.textStyleId = labelBoldStyle.id; // no font mutation afterward → link intact
```

**Never work around this with a manual value "that looks close enough."** If no
existing Text Style matches the weight actually needed, that's a signal that
the library is **missing a Text Style** — not an invitation to disconnect the
text from the system. Does adding the style lack legitimacy? No: a distinct
emphasis weight (e.g. Bold for a CTA vs Regular for a form label) is a real
typography decision, not a cosmetic detail — it deserves its own token,
propagated everywhere: `tokens/semantic.json` (`typography.*` composite) →
`tokens/figma-text-styles.json` (generates the Text Style via Tokens Studio) →
`tokens/component.json` (component token referencing it) → compiled CSS
(`npm run tokens`) → code component (`components/agtc-*.js`) → Figma (Text
Style created/applied) → documentation (`guidelines/components/*.md`). Never
a Figma-only fix.

## 20. Instance-swap icons — `constraints: SCALE` mandatory at every nested level

> **2026-07-07 incident.** The icons (`Icon / <name>` component, `Foundations / Icons`
> page) had been rebuilt at 24×24 with real Lucide paths (closing out the
> 2026-07-06 incident — gray placeholder squares). But used in instance-swap
> inside `agtc-button` (the `icon-prefix`/`icon-suffix` slot resized to 18×18),
> some icons overflowed the button, overlapping the label — only visible with
> certain icon shapes, not all (e.g. `plus` looked fine, `layout-dashboard`
> clearly overflowed).

### Cause

Resizing an instance (`instance.resize(18, 18)`) only cascades the scaling down
to children **if every child, at every level of the hierarchy, carries
`constraints: { horizontal: 'SCALE', vertical: 'SCALE' }` relative to its
direct parent**. A child left at `MIN`/`MIN` (the default for
`figma.createNodeFromSvg()` and `figma.createFrame()`) stays frozen at its
native size — it ignores the parent's resize and silently overflows.

Structure of each icon: `Icon / <name>` (COMPONENT 24×24) → `Frame` (24×24,
wrapper created by `createNodeFromSvg`) → `Vector` × N (paths). The `Vector`
nodes did have `SCALE/SCALE` (inherited from the SVG export), but the
intermediate `Frame` had stayed at `MIN/MIN` — a single non-compliant level
is enough to break the whole scaling chain.

### Rule

```
✅ After creating/modifying any Icon component, check `constraints` on EVERY
   direct child at every ancestor level down to the leaf (not just the first level)
✅ Explicitly set { horizontal:'SCALE', vertical:'SCALE' } on these children —
   never assume it's already the case
✅ Test resizing an INSTANCE (not just the master) with an icon whose path
   touches the edges (e.g. layout-dashboard, cpu, boxes) — symmetric, centered
   icons (plus, x, check) visually mask the bug
❌ Never assume a child inherits SCALE behavior from its own child —
   each level of the hierarchy has its own, independent constraints
```

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT — fixes all 81 icons in one pass (2026-07-07 incident)
const icons = page.findAllWithCriteria({types:['COMPONENT']}).filter(n => n.name.startsWith('Icon / '));
for (const icon of icons) {
  const frame = icon.children.find(c => c.name === 'Frame');
  frame.constraints = { horizontal: 'SCALE', vertical: 'SCALE' };
}
```

Once this fix is applied at the master level, `instance.swapComponent(otherIcon)`
preserves the instance's size (e.g. 18×18) and the new icon automatically
adapts to it — that's the whole point of instance-swap: compose freely without
re-fixing the size on every swap.

---

## 21. Mandatory validation — dimensions, contrast, display

> **Absolute rule (2026-07-07, following the §16/§17/§20 incidents): no component
> and no page can be considered done without passing these three validations.**
> This is not an optional visual checklist — these are three scripts to actually
> run via `use_figma` before reporting a component as finished, on the affected
> component/page AND on anything touched indirectly (e.g. modifying an Icon
> master affects every usage of it elsewhere in the file).

Historical trigger: icons overflowing their slot (§20), an `icon-wrap` background
that lost its opacity mid-build and made the icon invisible (same color as the
background), a hardcoded gap instead of a token. All three bugs would have been
caught immediately by the scripts below — they went unnoticed because no
programmatic check had been run, only a quick visual read-through.

### A. Dimensions — no overflow, no misalignment

**Pass criterion:** for every child node (excluding `_prefixed` decorative nodes
with `layoutPositioning:"ABSOLUTE"`, and excluding intentional focus rings with
`strokeAlign:"OUTSIDE"`), the child's bounds must stay inside its direct
parent's bounds.

```javascript
// Run on every modified page — detects any overflow
function findOverflows(root) {
  const issues = [];
  function walk(node) {
    if (!('children' in node)) return;
    for (const child of node.children) {
      const isDecorative = child.name.startsWith('_') && child.layoutPositioning === 'ABSOLUTE';
      const isFocusRing = child.strokeAlign === 'OUTSIDE';
      if (!isDecorative && !isFocusRing && 'width' in node) {
        const overflowsRight  = child.x + child.width  > node.width  + 0.5;
        const overflowsBottom = child.y + child.height > node.height + 0.5;
        const overflowsLeft   = child.x < -0.5;
        const overflowsTop    = child.y < -0.5;
        if (overflowsRight || overflowsBottom || overflowsLeft || overflowsTop) {
          issues.push({ parent: node.name, child: child.name, parentSize: [node.width, node.height], childBounds: [child.x, child.y, child.x+child.width, child.y+child.height] });
        }
      }
      walk(child);
    }
  }
  walk(root);
  return issues;
}
```

Run `findOverflows(pageNode)` (or on a specific `ComponentSet`/instance) and
treat any non-empty result as a blocker — not just a flag.

**Instance-swap special case (icons, avatars, etc.):** test the resize with at
least one "at-risk" value (content close to the edges), not only the default
value — see §20, where the `plus` icon masked the bug and `layout-dashboard`
revealed it.

### B. Contrast — an actual calculation, not a visual estimate

**WCAG thresholds:**
- Normal text: **4.5:1** minimum
- Large text (≥ 24px, or ≥ 18.66px Bold): **3:1** minimum
- Icons / UI graphics (WCAG 1.4.11): **3:1** minimum

```javascript
// WCAG contrast calculation — composites semi-transparent backgrounds up the tree
function relLum(c) {
  const lin = v => v <= 0.03928 ? v / 12.92 : Math.pow((v + 0.055) / 1.055, 2.4);
  return 0.2126 * lin(c.r) + 0.7152 * lin(c.g) + 0.0722 * lin(c.b);
}
function contrastRatio(c1, c2) {
  const L1 = relLum(c1), L2 = relLum(c2);
  const [light, dark] = L1 > L2 ? [L1, L2] : [L2, L1];
  return (light + 0.05) / (dark + 0.05);
}
function compositeOver(fg, opacity, bg) {
  return { r: fg.r*opacity + bg.r*(1-opacity), g: fg.g*opacity + bg.g*(1-opacity), b: fg.b*opacity + bg.b*(1-opacity) };
}
function resolveBackground(node, canvasBg = {r:1,g:1,b:1}) {
  const chain = [];
  let n = node.parent;
  while (n && n.type !== 'PAGE') { chain.unshift(n); n = n.parent; }
  let bg = canvasBg;
  for (const anc of chain) {
    if (!('fills' in anc) || !Array.isArray(anc.fills)) continue;
    for (const f of anc.fills) {
      if (f.type === 'SOLID' && f.visible !== false) bg = compositeOver(f.color, f.opacity ?? 1, bg);
    }
  }
  return bg;
}
// Usage on a text node: requiredRatio depends on fontSize/fontWeight (see thresholds above)
const bg = resolveBackground(textNode);
const fg = textNode.fills[0].color;
const ratio = contrastRatio(fg, bg);
```

Treat any ratio under the threshold as a blocker, **including tinted icons on a
tinted background** (e.g. the `icon-wrap` incident: a solid `action-primary`
icon on a 12% `action-primary` background — the calculation would have
immediately given a ratio close to 1:1).

### ⚠️ Frequent pitfall — a focus ring the same color as the component's background

> **2026-07-07 incident.** `agtc-button`'s focus ring (Primary, teal background)
> used `border-focus`, which resolves to **the same teal** as the button's
> background — a 1:1 ratio between the ring and the component it surrounds.
> The same risk exists everywhere a component with an `action-primary`
> background (Toggle on, Checkbox checked, Radio selected, Segmented selected)
> gets a focus ring bound to the same token.

**Standard solution (W3C technique C40 — "Two-Color Focus Indicator"), not a
local invention:** use **two colors with strong contrast between them** (one
light, one dark) for the ring — as long as these two colors have **at least a
9:1 contrast ratio between them**, one of the two will *always* have at least
3:1 against any solid background, without needing a different ring per color
variant.
Reference: [W3C WCAG — Technique C40](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C40.html).

```
✅ A light band (white) directly against the component + a dark band (teal/black)
   on the outside — the light band alone guarantees contrast against ANY
   background, including one the same color as the dark band
✅ Each band ≥ 2px — verified: white (spread 2) + teal (spread 6) on Button
✅ Verified: white vs teal = 5.28:1 (> 3:1 required) — so even if the outer
   ring visually "disappears" on a background of the same hue, the component
   stays compliant AND visually larger (enlarged silhouette) — explicitly
   accepted by the user as a sufficient criterion: "even if it's the same
   color, the Focus state should look bigger because of the wider outline"
❌ Never assume a single-color ring is enough against every background
❌ Never evaluate a focus ring only on its internal ratio (ring vs background) —
   always also check the light band (ring vs any background, the C40 guarantee)
```

**Width reference:** Material Design 3 uses `--md-focus-ring-width: 3px` by
default for its focus ring — our two bands (2px + 6px = 8px total visible
width) are in the same order of magnitude, slightly more generous to stay
legible even in low-resolution exports.

**Related API pitfall (Figma Plugin):** `figma.variables.setBoundVariableForEffect()`
correctly binds `boundVariables` but doesn't always immediately recompute the
effect's literal `color` field — check the resolved `color` after binding, and
force it explicitly if needed (`effect.color = {r,g,b,a}` in addition to the binding):
```javascript
let ring = { type:'DROP_SHADOW', color:{r:0,g:0,b:0,a:1}, spread:6, /* ... */ };
ring = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForEffect(ring, 'color', borderFocusVar);
ring.color = { r:0, g:0.478, b:0.408, a:1 }; // force-sync if the render still shows the old color
```

### C. On-page display — measurable elegance, not just "it looks fine"

- [ ] Icon ⇄ label gap: **always** a token (`space/control/gap` or equivalent),
      never a hardcoded value — see §18
- [ ] Vertical alignment: icon and text share the same `counterAxisAlignItems:"CENTER"`
      on their parent — no baseline offset
- [ ] No default `itemSpacing:0` on a container that later receives icon+text
      children (a pitfall hit on Button — the component had originally been
      built text-only, `itemSpacing` never revisited when icons were added)
- [ ] `findOverflows()` (§A) returns an empty result for the entire page, not
      just the modified component — a neighboring page can inherit a modified master
- [ ] Final screenshot at a `maxDimension` high enough to see details (≥ 900px
      on the relevant area) — a too-small screenshot hides exactly this kind of bug

### When to run these three validations

```
✅ After EVERY component creation or modification, before declaring it done
✅ After EVERY master modification (Icon, Text Style, variable) — audit every
   usage elsewhere in the file, not just the spot just modified
✅ Before the final verification screenshot of a work session
❌ Never rely on a low-resolution screenshot as sufficient validation
❌ Never validate a component by testing only one value/variant per property
   (e.g. testing instance-swap with a single icon proves nothing about the other 80)
```

---

## 22. Mandatory full audit — 9 categories

> Referenced by `.claude/rules/figma-library-governance.md`. Run on any newly
> created/modified page, before declaring it done, and on every explicit
> request ("audit", "check the whole file", "full screenshot"). Also run
> automatically, weekly, against the ENTIRE library (not just recently touched
> pages) by a scheduled cloud agent — see ADR-079. That routine's prompt reads
> this exact section as its source of truth, so keep this checklist accurate:
> a change here changes what the weekly routine checks, with no separate copy
> to update.

### 1. Accessibility
- [ ] Focus ring visible on every focusable state — technique C40 (§20), never
      a simple outline touching the element (see the 2026-07-07 "bigger button
      ≠ focus ring" incident)
- [ ] Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (≥ 3:1 if ≥ 24px or ≥ 18.66px Bold) — §21.B script
- [ ] Icon/UI graphic contrast ≥ 3:1
- [ ] `disabled` states exempt from contrast (WCAG) — don't treat these as bugs

### 2. Page display
- [ ] `findOverflows()` (§21.A) returns an empty array on `page-wrapper` AND on
      the `ComponentSet` itself
- [ ] No orphaned node at the page's root level (leftover test rectangles/instances
      — see the 2026-07-07 incident, two test leftovers left on Button)
- [ ] Icon ⇄ label gap always via `space/control/gap` (or equivalent), never
      hardcoded (§18)

### 3. Variables
- [ ] No fill/stroke/padding/radius without `boundVariables` — scan script below
- [ ] Component token prioritized over semantic (§18)
- [ ] Never a primitive token bound directly to a component

```javascript
// Scan for fills/strokes not bound to a Variable on a ComponentSet
function scanUnboundPaints(root) {
  const issues = [];
  function walk(node) {
    if ('fills' in node && Array.isArray(node.fills)) {
      node.fills.forEach((f, i) => {
        if (f.type === 'SOLID' && f.visible !== false && !f.boundVariables?.color) {
          issues.push({ node: node.name, prop: `fills[${i}]`, color: f.color });
        }
      });
    }
    if ('strokes' in node && Array.isArray(node.strokes)) {
      node.strokes.forEach((s, i) => {
        if (s.type === 'SOLID' && s.visible !== false && !s.boundVariables?.color) {
          issues.push({ node: node.name, prop: `strokes[${i}]`, color: s.color });
        }
      });
    }
    if ('children' in node) node.children.forEach(walk);
  }
  walk(root);
  return issues;
}
```

### 4. Styles (Text Styles)
- [ ] Every `TEXT` has a non-empty `textStyleId` (§19) — never manual
      fontName/fontSize that "resembles" an existing style
- [ ] **Every Text Style has all 4 properties (`fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`,
      `lineHeight`) bound to a Variable** — never a literal value, even if the
      displayed value looks correct (see the `scanUnboundTextStyleProperties`
      script below)

```javascript
function scanMissingTextStyles(root) {
  const issues = [];
  root.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ['TEXT'] }).forEach(t => {
    if (!t.textStyleId) issues.push({ node: t.name, characters: t.characters.slice(0, 30) });
  });
  return issues;
}
```

> **2026-07-09 incident.** 10 of the library's 11 Text Styles (all except
> `typography/detail`) had **no** variable bound at all — literal values
> (`fontSize: 40`, etc.) with only a text description pointing at the token
> name, with no real link. Worse: `detail-bold` and `label-bold` had **no
> Figma variable whatsoever** (no size, weight, or line-height), even though
> `tokens/semantic.json` fully defines them — a genuine code↔Figma parity gap
> that stayed invisible as long as no audit script specifically checked the
> Text Styles (the §3 `scanUnboundPaints` scan only covers fills/strokes, not
> typography). Only caught because a human compared a correctly bound Text
> Style against the existing ones.

```javascript
// Scan every local Text Style — detects unbound properties
async function scanUnboundTextStyleProperties() {
  const styles = await figma.getLocalTextStylesAsync();
  const required = ['fontSize', 'fontFamily', 'fontWeight', 'lineHeight'];
  const issues = [];
  for (const s of styles) {
    const bound = Object.keys(s.boundVariables || {});
    const missing = required.filter(k => !bound.includes(k));
    if (missing.length) issues.push({ style: s.name, missing });
  }
  return issues;
}
```

```
✅ Always bind fontSize/fontFamily/fontWeight/lineHeight on EVERY Text Style created
   — never just a text description pointing at the token name
✅ Run scanUnboundTextStyleProperties() on the WHOLE library (not just newly
   created styles) on every §22 audit — the debt can be old and invisible
✅ If a composite token (e.g. detail-bold, label-bold) referenced by chrome text
   has no matching Figma Variable, create it as an alias to the right primitive
   BEFORE binding the Text Style — never leave a Text Style unbound
❌ Never treat a "correct-looking" literal value as sufficient — without a
   binding, a future primitive change (e.g. a typographic rescale) won't propagate
```

### 4bis. Local fonts — check `loadFontAsync` BEFORE building on a font

> **2026-07-09 incident.** A locally installed font (`Atkinson Hyperlegible
> Mono`) is selectable and renders correctly in the interactive Figma editor —
> but `figma.loadFontAsync({family, style})` systematically fails in the
> Plugin API sandbox (`use_figma`), even after restarting the desktop app,
> with the error *"The font family ... does not exist"*. A Text Style created
> by hand in the UI with this font stays inspectable by script (reading,
> binding variables both work) but **cannot be applied to any other node by
> script** (`setTextStyleIdAsync` fails with `unloaded font`) — a hard
> platform ceiling, not a matter of insufficient local installation.

```javascript
// MANDATORY check before basing a Text Style effort on a non-standard font
// (not in Google Fonts / Figma's default library)
async function canLoadFont(family, style) {
  try {
    await figma.loadFontAsync({ family, style });
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

```
✅ Before any effort based on a non-standard local font: test canLoadFont()
   for EVERY style used (Regular AND Bold are not guaranteed equivalent)
✅ If canLoadFont() fails: either use the token's documented CSS stack fallback
   (e.g. JetBrains Mono, 2nd link), or accept that applying it to nodes stays a
   manual human task in the Figma UI (the Text Style can still be created and
   bound to variables by script — only the APPLICATION to new nodes is blocked)
❌ Never assume a font "visible in the Figma picker" is usable by a script —
   these are two different access paths (interactive rendering vs Plugin API),
   see Figma help "Add a font to Figma"
❌ Never loop indefinitely on app restarts hoping the font will load — if
   `canLoadFont()` fails twice in a row after a confirmed restart, treat it as
   a platform ceiling and escalate the fallback option to the human instead of retrying
```

### 5. States
- [ ] Figma states match exactly those of the code component (grep the
      `:hover`, `:focus-visible`, `:disabled`, custom states like `loading`/`error` in
      `components/agtc-<comp>.js`)
- [ ] No missing state, no invented state

### 6. Variants
- [ ] `componentPropertyDefinitions.Variant.variantOptions` (or equivalent) matches
      exactly the union type / `argTypes.variant.options` from the `.stories.js` file
- [ ] Properties (BOOLEAN/TEXT/INSTANCE_SWAP) match the props exposed by the Lit
      component (`static properties`)

### 7. In-page documentation
- [ ] `section-header` (title + description), `section-showcase` (VARIANTS),
      `section-states` or equivalent, `section-tokens`, `section-dos-donts`,
      `section-links` — all present (§8)
- [ ] The `TOKENS USED` table reflects the real `component.<comp>.*` tokens, not
      the raw semantic ones (§18)

### 8. Links
- [ ] `section-links` contains at minimum: Guidelines, 1 UX source (NN/g, W3C APG, IxDF…),
      1 WCAG/ADR reference, Tokens — see `ux-patterns-sources.md`
- [ ] No link duplicated between the header and the bottom of the page (§10)

### 9. Code ↔ Figma parity after a direct human visual instruction

> **2026-07-07 incident.** The user asked to remove `.icon-wrap`'s background on
> Feature-card directly in Figma (visual feedback, not a code read). The change
> was made on the Figma side without immediately checking
> `agtc-feature-card.js` — creating a silent Figma↔code gap
> (`background: rgba(18, 165, 148, .12)` stayed in the code). A separate
> developer agent had to fix the code afterward to bring the two back into sync.

**Rule**: any visual change made in Figma **based on direct human feedback**
(not sourced from reading the code) inherently creates a gap with the code
until the code is updated — this is not a mistake in itself, but the gap must
be **made visible**, never silent.

```
✅ After any visual change requested directly (not read from the code):
   1. Immediately check the matching components/agtc-<comp>.js file
   2. If the code diverges, note the gap explicitly (e.g. a "fixed" row in the
      TOKENS USED table, as done for Feature-card) — never silently
   3. Offer the user a handoff prompt to the developer agent
      (see `.claude/rules/figma-library-governance.md` — code is the source of truth)
   4. Once the code is fixed, recheck Figma ↔ code and clear the gap note
❌ Never assume a "Figma-only" visual change will stay consistent with the code
   without an explicit propagation action
❌ Never let a Figma token table claim a value the code doesn't actually
   produce (or vice versa) without an explicit note of the gap
```

## 23. Testing variant × state × content combinations — the EightShapes method

> **2026-07-07 incident.** Button had a focus ring that worked perfectly… as
> long as the label stayed "Button" and no icon property was on. As soon as a
> designer combined `State=Focus` with both icon properties, the ring (sized
> once and for all at build time, as a static sibling of the pill) no longer
> tracked the button's actual size — full visual overlap. The bug was only
> detectable by testing a **combination**, never by looking at each variant in isolation.

**Methodological reference**: [Nathan Curtis (EightShapes) — Component Visual Test
Cases](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/component-visual-test-cases-e501e2d21def).
Core principle: **never test an exhaustive grid of every combination**
(an unmanageable combinatorial explosion) — instead test **representative edge
cases**, organized into 5 categories:

```
1. Properties    — every property value works (already covered by the variant
                    grid itself — not the priority here)
2. Content       — text/icons: shortest realistic, longest realistic,
                    and deliberately too much (stress test) — not just the nominal case
3. Spacing       — base layout with several elements shown together at once
4. Layout        — varied component width (narrower / wider than the norm)
5. Composition   — nested slots/content tested at several proportions
```

### Practical rule for this Figma file

For any component that has **both** (a) a visually additive interactive state (Focus,
Selected, Hover…) **and** (b) content of variable size (free text, optional
icons) — combine both explicitly before considering the component done:

```javascript
// Targeted test — not exhaustive: the plausible worst case for THIS component
// 1. Create an instance on the most "visually additive" state variant (Focus, Selected)
// 2. Turn on ALL optional content properties at the same time (icons, etc.)
// 3. Use the longest realistic text (not a giant lorem ipsum — a real long label)
// 4. Screenshot + findOverflows() — if it breaks, it's structural, not cosmetic
const inst = componentSet.children.find(c => c.name.includes('State=Focus')).createInstance();
inst.setProperties({
  [showIconPrefixKey]: true,
  [showIconSuffixKey]: true,
  [labelKey]: 'A label representative of the realistic worst case',
});
```

### Components with identified risk (variable content + visually additive state)

| Component | Variable content | Additive state | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Button | Label + 2 optional icons | Focus (ring) | Fixed 2026-07-07 — ring now in a HUG auto-layout wrapper, never again a statically sized sibling |
| Segmented | Option labels (2-5, free length) | Focused (ring) | Fixed 2026-07-07 — same wrapper pattern |
| Input | Label + Placeholder/Value + icons | Focus (border) | Border is internal to `.control`, not a sibling — lower risk but should be retested if the structure changes |
| Toggle/Checkbox/Radio | Label (free text) | Focus (ring) | Low risk — the ring surrounds a track/box with a **fixed size**, independent of the label text (a separate element) |

**Architecture lesson**: a focus ring (or any additive indicator) must
**never** be a sibling node sized once and then frozen. It must either:
(a) surround its content via a `HUG` auto-layout wrapper (the content grows →
the wrapper follows automatically, with no manual recalculation), or (b)
target an element whose size is structurally fixed and independent of the
variable content (the Toggle/Checkbox/Radio case).

## 24. Monospace presentation typography — isolating docs from components

> **Rule adopted 2026-07-08.** All **presentation/documentation** text on a
> Figma page (section titles, descriptions, anatomy captions, grid column
> labels, token table headers, DO/DON'T text) uses the mono font **from the
> token**, not the content font, and not a font name guessed by eye. Goal:
> visually distinguish at a glance what is **meta** (the docs *about* the
> component) from what is **the component itself** (which keeps its real
> `Atkinson Hyperlegible` font).

### Source of truth — the token, never a guess

> General rule (`figma-library-governance.md` §1): **code is the source of
> truth**. For Monospace, that means tracing the token to its real value
> before creating anything in Figma — never starting from a font name pulled from memory.

```
Token          semantic.typography.mono.family
  → alias of   primitive.fontFamily.mono
  → value      'Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', 'Cascadia Code', monospace
  → CSS var    --agtc-semantic-typography-mono-family
  → consumer: components/agtc-code-block.js
```

First link in the stack available in Figma → **`Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono`**
(the `JetBrains Mono` / `Cascadia Code` fallbacks are a browser CSS fallback
stack, not variants to replicate in Figma).

### Real values wired into `agtc-code-block.js` — to reproduce, not reinvent

Debt paid down on 2026-07-08 (commits `15070ef` token(semantic), `3dedc58`
fix(component) — see ADR-067). The component no longer has any hardcoded
typography value; these tokens are the exact reference for the
`typography/doc-mono` Text Style:

| Usage in the component | Size | Weight | Line-height | Letter-spacing | Token |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Code body | 14px | 400 (regular) | **1.6** | normal (0em) | `component.code-block.default.font-size` (= `semantic.typography.label.size`) · `semantic.typography.detail.line-height` (= `primitive.lineHeight.reading`) |
| Language badge (header) | 12px | **500 (medium)** | normal | **0.06em** | `semantic.typography.detail.size` · `semantic.typography.label.weight` (= `primitive.fontWeight.medium`) · `semantic.typography.letter-spacing.wide` (= `primitive.typography.letterSpacing.wide`) |

> Decision made to set the language badge at 500 (medium) rather than 600: no
> new `semibold` primitive was created — the existing `fontWeight.medium` was
> reused, approved by the Design System Lead + Principal Designer (ADR-067).
> Don't create a Figma Text Style at "weight 600" — it doesn't exist on the code side.

### Scope — what goes Monospace, what does NOT

| ✅ Monospace (presentation text, meta) | ❌ Stays in the real content font |
|---|---|
| Section titles (`section-header`, "ANATOMY", "VARIANTS"…) | **The component's own label** (e.g. "Button" inside an `agtc-button`) |
| Descriptions and explanatory paragraphs on the page | Any text **inside a component instance** |
| Anatomy captions, column/row labels of the variant grid | Values displayed by a component in a real-world situation |
| Token table headers and cells | |
| DO/DON'T column badges/text, link pill text | |

> **Absolute boundary:** as soon as text lives **inside a component instance**,
> it keeps the component's font. Monospace only applies to the surrounding
> **documentation chrome**. It's this font contrast that creates the requested visual separation.

### Implementation — a dedicated Text Style, never a manual fontName (§19)

Create/reuse a `typography/doc-mono` library Text Style (and its weight
variants if needed, `typography/doc-mono-bold`) and apply it via
`textStyleId` — never a hand-coded monospace `fontName` (same reasons as
§19: text that "looks like" mono isn't bound to the system).

```javascript
// The mono family already exists (§14) — check the style before use
await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono", style: "Regular" });
// Apply the library's doc Text Style (created once), not a raw fontName
docTextNode.textStyleId = TX["typography/doc-mono"].id;
// No font mutation afterward (otherwise textStyleId reverts to "" — §19 pitfall)
```

```
✅ Presentation text → textStyleId = typography/doc-mono (or -bold)
✅ The showcased component keeps Atkinson Hyperlegible (its real font)
❌ Never switch a component's internal label to mono (breaks parity with the code)
❌ Never hand-code the mono font — always via the Text Style (§19)
```

---

## 25. Page content width — never let the wrapper overflow

> **Rule adopted 2026-07-08.** Trigger: the `Foundations / Logos` page was
> still overflowing its `page-wrapper` (wide content pushed outside the white
> background, visible on the canvas's `#535353` gray). Generalizes the §17
> principle (WRAP+FILL) to **all page content**, not just state/instance rows.

### Canonical width

```
page-wrapper width: 1440 px (fixed, counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED")
Section horizontal padding: 80 px on each side
→ Usable content width: 1440 − 160 = 1280 px MAXIMUM
```

No content element (frame, grid, logo image, row) should exceed **1280 px**
wide once placed in a section. Any element that might be wider than the
available space must either switch to `layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL"`, be
in a `layoutWrap = "WRAP"` container (§17), or be scaled to fit.

### Verification rule (run on every page, not just Logos)

```javascript
// Reuses findOverflows() (§21.A): any non-decorative child whose bounds
// exceed its direct parent's = a blocker. ALSO target the entire page-wrapper.
const overflows = findOverflows(pageWrapper);
// Logos case: a logo grid or a single logo with a native width > 1280
// → constrain the grid to FILL + WRAP, or resize each logo tile
```

```
✅ Content ≤ 1280 px wide in every section (1440 wrapper − 2×80 padding)
✅ Variable-width grids/rows: layoutSizingHorizontal="FILL" + layoutWrap="WRAP" (§17)
✅ Oversized images (logos, illustrations): proportional resize to fit within 1280
✅ findOverflows(pageWrapper) must return an empty array before declaring the page done
❌ Never let an element overflow onto the canvas gray, even "by a few pixels" (§17)
❌ Never widen the page-wrapper past 1440 to "fit" oversized content
   → fix the content, not the wrapper
```

---

## 26. Post-audit checklist — line-height units, container nesting, alignment, stale reads

> **Rule adopted 2026-07-23.** Trigger: a routine "verify the mono pilot rendering" request
> uncovered five distinct, previously-undetected defects across the whole file — a broken
> `lineHeight` unit on all 15 Text Styles, cropped focus rings on 2 pages, invisible tag text on
> 3 pages, a hardcoded color failing WCAG contrast, and (later, from a user report) a decorative
> background that didn't scale with its content. None of these were caught by `findOverflows()`
> or the existing clipping checks — they need their own verification steps, documented here so
> they become a standing checklist, not a one-off fix.

### 26.1 `lineHeight` must be `{unit:"PERCENT"}`, never `{unit:"PIXELS"}` with a bare multiplier

A Text Style's `lineHeight` binding can silently carry the *token's numeric value* (e.g. `1.6`,
meant as a unitless CSS multiplier) under the **wrong unit** — `{unit:"PIXELS", value:1.6}`
instead of `{unit:"PERCENT", value:160}`. On a single line of text this is invisible (nothing to
space out). The moment that text wraps to 2+ lines, the lines render on top of each other.

```javascript
// Audit every Text Style before trusting it
const styles = await figma.getLocalTextStylesAsync();
const broken = styles.filter(s => s.lineHeight.unit === 'PIXELS' && s.lineHeight.value < 10);
// value < 10 is the tell — a real pixel line-height is never that small
```

```
✅ Convert primitive.lineHeight.* (a unitless number, e.g. "1.6") to Figma's lineHeight as
   {unit:"PERCENT", value: primitiveValue * 100} — never as {unit:"PIXELS", value: primitiveValue}
✅ Re-check ALL styles sharing a category (reading/heading/display), not just the one you're
   touching — this bug is copy-pasted across every style built the same way
❌ Never assume a style is fine because it "looks right" on short, single-line text
```

**Amendment (2026-07-27, building `doc/page-frame`):** the same bug hits a raw `TEXT` node's
`lineHeight` bound directly to a Variable via `setBoundVariable('lineHeight', var)` — not just
published Text Styles. Figma always resolves a Variable-bound `lineHeight` as `PIXELS`, even
when the variable stores a unitless multiplier (`primitive/lineHeight/display` = `1`, a correct
primitive value) — there is no way to bind a percent-semantics lineHeight to a Variable. Hit on
`semantic/marketing/typography/display/line-height`, never exercised before (no prior text node
had used it), so invisible to every earlier audit. Fix: never bind `lineHeight` to a Variable on
an ad-hoc text node for a unitless-multiplier token — set a plain, unbound
`{unit:"PERCENT", value:100}` instead, same as the Text Style fix above.
`scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js`'s `findBrokenLineHeights()` now scans both Text Styles and
any `TEXT` node with a Variable-bound `lineHeight`, not just Text Styles.

### 26.2 A decorative background must be a HUG parent of its content, never an independent sibling

Pattern to avoid: `section-content-bg` (a fixed- or manually-resized decorative frame) sitting
**next to** a content frame (`typo-content`, `spacing-content`, …) at the same page level,
relying on both frames' authored sizes staying in sync by hand. The moment the content frame
grows (new row added, translated text is longer, a token is added), the background doesn't
follow — content spills onto the plain white page background, breaking the visual container.

```
✅ appendChild the content frame INTO the background frame (real nesting, not visual coincidence)
✅ Background frame: layoutMode="VERTICAL", primaryAxisSizingMode="AUTO" (hug), padding set once
✅ Content frame: layoutSizingHorizontal="FIXED" at its authored width, height stays HUG
✅ Any time content is added/removed/re-translated, the background auto-follows — nothing to sync
❌ Never position a "container-looking" background as a sibling frame at a coincidentally-matching
   size — it WILL drift the next time the content changes (2026-07-23 incident: adding 4 rows to
   `typography`'s type ramp left the last 3 rows rendering outside `section-content-bg`)
```

### 26.3 A `FILL`/`layoutGrow=1` spacer defeats left-alignment in table-like rows

If a row's last element (a sample bar, a status pill) is meant to **start at the same X across
every row** for easy visual comparison, the text/spacer column immediately before it must be
`layoutSizingHorizontal="FIXED"` at a width wide enough for the longest row's content — never
`FILL`/`layoutGrow=1`. A `FILL` spacer eats all remaining row width, which pushes the following
element flush against the row's right edge instead of anchoring it to a shared left position —
the classic "space-between" trick, wrong for anything meant to read as a comparable bar chart.

```
✅ Table/list rows where a trailing element (bar, badge) should align across rows:
   give the preceding text column a FIXED width sized to the longest content in that column
❌ FILL/layoutGrow on a column whose only job is "push the next thing to the far edge" —
   that's a right-alignment tool, not a left-alignment one
```

### 26.4 `.height` / `.absoluteBoundingBox` can lie right after a script mutation — use `.absoluteRenderBounds`

Reading `node.height` or `node.absoluteBoundingBox` on an auto-layout child immediately after a
style/font change in the **same session** (even a fresh `use_figma` call) can return a stale or
nonsensical value (`height: 1` on a 32px-bold heading has been observed). This corrupts anything
computed from it — including auto-layout's own positioning of the next sibling, which is how a
title/subtitle pair ended up rendering on top of each other even though geometry read as
"non-overlapping" at the time.

```
✅ For ground-truth rendered geometry, always read node.absoluteRenderBounds — it reflects the
   actual paint, not a cached layout value
✅ After adding/mutating nodes inside an auto-layout HUG frame, re-fetch the frame fresh
   (getNodeByIdAsync in a NEW use_figma call) and check absoluteRenderBounds before trusting it
❌ Never conclude "no overlap" from .height/.absoluteBoundingBox alone right after a mutation —
   cross-check with a screenshot at a real resolution (scale ≥ 2) when anything looks tight
```

### 26.5 Every fill must resolve `boundVariables` — a raw color is both a token violation and an a11y risk

`node.fills[0].boundVariables` being empty (`{}`) on a text/shape fill means the color is
hand-painted, not tokenized — a direct violation of `tokens-system.md`, AND a sign nobody
contrast-checked it (the 2026-07-23 `PATTERNS` tag: hardcoded gray text at ~12% opacity of the
same gray for its own background → 2.86:1 contrast, below the 4.5:1 AA minimum for small text).

```javascript
// Audit sweep — run on any page before calling it done
const unbound = page.findAll(n => 'fills' in n && Array.isArray(n.fills))
  .filter(n => n.fills.some(f => f.type === 'SOLID' && f.visible !== false && !f.boundVariables?.color));
```

```
✅ Every SOLID fill on text/shapes resolves through boundVariables.color to a semantic token
✅ When fixing a hardcoded color, bind to an EXISTING semantic token matching the same resolved
   value/role (e.g. semantic/color/text/secondary) rather than inventing a new one
✅ Compute contrast (WCAG relative luminance) for any text-on-fill pair discovered this way —
   don't assume the existing pairing was ever checked
❌ Never leave `boundVariables: {}` on a fill "because the color looks right" — it will drift
   silently the next time a token value changes, since nothing links it back
```

### 26.7 A variable can resolve by ID while its collection is orphaned — check `getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()`, not just `getVariableByIdAsync()`

**2026-07-23 incident.** `page-wrapper`'s background fill showed a "?" in the Figma UI (broken
variable), yet `figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(id)` returned a perfectly valid-looking
object — name, type, resolved color, all present. The tell was one level up:
`variable.variableCollectionId` pointed at a collection (`"Agentica — Tokens"`, an early,
pre-ADR-059 token collection) that **`getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()` no longer lists** —
i.e. Figma's own UI can't resolve it as live/editable even though the raw ID lookup still
succeeds. Scope when audited: **~1600 fill/stroke bindings across all 18 pages**, essentially
the entire file's chrome color layer, silently pointing at a collection that isn't part of the
current `primitives` / `semantic` / `component` / `semantic.dark` hierarchy.

```javascript
// A variable "resolving" is not proof it's healthy — cross-check its collection
const collections = await figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync();
const knownGoodIds = new Set(collections.map(c => c.id));
const v = await figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(someBoundVarId);
const isOrphaned = v && !knownGoodIds.has(v.variableCollectionId); // true = broken, even though v itself is non-null
```

```
✅ Cross-check every bound variable's variableCollectionId against getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()
   — a non-null getVariableByIdAsync() result is NOT sufficient proof of health
✅ To fix: find the matching name in the current semantic/component collection
   (orphan "color/text/secondary" → current "semantic/color/text/secondary") and rebind via
   figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(paint, 'color', newVariable)
❌ Never trust a "?" badge in the Figma UI as the only signal — the Plugin API can mask it
❌ Never assume a single fixed "?" instance is isolated — this class of bug is copy-pasted
   across every node built from the same original template, audit the WHOLE file
```

### 26.8 Auto-layout padding/gap/radius must be bound too — not just fills

The token-binding requirement (§26.5) applies identically to **layout** properties, not only
paint. `node.paddingLeft/Right/Top/Bottom`, `itemSpacing`, and the four corner-radius properties
can silently hold a hardcoded number with zero entry in `node.boundVariables` — the Figma
properties panel shows a plain number with no visual distinction from a bound one unless you
look for the small variable-link icon.

**2026-07-23 incident.** The `Button` ComponentSet's own variants had `paddingLeft/Right: 20`,
`paddingTop/Bottom: 10`, `cornerRadius: 8` — hardcoded, unbound, and **not matching the
documented `TOKENS USED` table** (16px / 8px / 6px) NOR the real CSS
(`components/agtc-button.js`, confirmed by grep before touching anything). A nested `pill` child
inside each Focus-state variant repeated the same hardcoded values one level deeper — the
top-level fix alone would have missed it. A file-wide sweep afterward found the same pattern on
`Input` (135 instances), `Segmented` (480), `Checkbox` (53), `Toggle`/`Radio` (14 each).

```
✅ Before binding, resolve the REAL value from code (tokens/component.json → tokens/semantic.json
   → tokens/primitives.json → the literal CSS custom property in components/agtc-*.js) — the
   Figma instance's current hardcoded number is not evidence of the correct value, it may have
   drifted (as it had here: 20/10/8 in Figma vs 16/8/6 in code)
✅ Check EVERY variant of a ComponentSet, and recurse into named wrapper children (e.g. "pill",
   "track", "field") — a fix on the outer variant frame does not propagate to nested frames
✅ Exclude the ComponentSet's own root layout from the audit — that governs the editor canvas
   arrangement of variants, never the rendered/instanced design
❌ Never assume a Figma instance's current padding/radius is correct just because it renders
   "fine" visually — compare against the code before binding, every time
```

### 26.9 Renames and deletions leave stale references — check text mentions AND internal links

> **Rule added 2026-07-24**, prompted by the redesign plan (§1.6.1,
> `Temp/plan-redesign-figma-2026-07-23.md`) renaming `INTRO`→`GETTING STARTED` and moving
> `COVER` under a new `UTILITY` page. Every check added to this file so far (§26.1–26.9)
> catches a node whose OWN property drifted — none of them catch a node whose text or link
> still references something else that changed. A rename or a page restructure is exactly the
> kind of change that leaves this behind, silently, because the stale text still renders fine.

Two distinct failure modes, both covered by `scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js`:

1. **Stale plain-text mentions** — a breadcrumb, eyebrow tag, or prose sentence that spells out
   an old name (`"See the INTRO page for..."`) after the referenced thing was renamed. Nothing
   in Figma flags this on its own — the text is perfectly valid, just wrong.
2. **Broken internal hyperlinks** — a text hyperlink of type `NODE` (Figma's "link to a frame"
   feature) whose target node was deleted or had its ID change. Figma doesn't surface this
   either; the link text still looks clickable.

```
✅ Maintain KNOWN_RENAMES at the top of audit-figma-file.js — every time a page, component, or
   pattern gets canonically renamed, add an { oldName: newName } entry immediately, in the same
   session as the rename
✅ Run findStaleNameReferences() (and the full auditPage()) on EVERY page, not just the one that
   was renamed — a page-A eyebrow tag can reference page B's old name
✅ Prefer a manual fix over applyKnownRenames() whenever the flagged text has mixed styling
   (bold substring, a hyperlink) or needs rewording beyond a straight swap — the helper does a
   literal find/replace only, it does not re-flow surrounding prose
✅ Once every reference is confirmed fixed (staleNameReferences returns empty for that
   oldName), remove the entry from KNOWN_RENAMES — it's a working list, not a permanent log
   (the permanent log lives in the plan document / commit history)
❌ Never treat "the renamed page itself looks right" as sufficient — the whole point of this
   check is catching references living on OTHER pages

### 26.10 Consolidated pre-"done" checklist for any Figma page work

Run `scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js` (paste into `use_figma`, one page per call, fan out in
parallel per the figma-use skill's multi-page rule) — it codifies checks 26.1–26.11 into one
script instead of scattered hand-copied snippets. A clean page returns every result array empty:

```
✅ orphanedVariables — §26.7 — empty
✅ unboundComponentProps — §26.8 — empty
✅ brokenLineHeights — §26.1 — empty
✅ staleNameReferences — §26.9 — empty (blocking: any text still spelling out an old name
   after a rename is a regression, fix in the same session, don't defer)
✅ brokenLinks — §26.9 — empty (blocking: an internal NODE-type hyperlink whose target no
   longer resolves)
✅ clippedEffects — § "Known errors" DROP_SHADOW row — empty (treat as candidates to verify
   visually, not automatic bugs — the check flags any clipsContent ancestor even when the effect
   has enough room and never actually gets cut)
✅ overflows — §21.A / §25 — empty (or only the known decorative _deco/Ellipse header bleed)
✅ missingWrapper — §26.11 — empty (blocking: exactly ONE top-level `page-wrapper` must hold
   every live content section; anything else flagged here is a bare top-level sibling that
   escaped containment — the actual structural bug, not just a visual symptom)
✅ widthMismatches — §26.11 — empty (secondary signal only: a top-level child whose width
   doesn't match the page's dominant width — can catch drift even when missingWrapper is
   clean, e.g. one child inside the wrapper never resized, but never a substitute for it)
✅ Decorative background nesting (§26.2) — appendChild, don't co-position — not yet automated,
   check by hand: does a "…-content" frame sit as a CHILD of its "…-content-bg", or merely
   beside it at a coincidentally-matching size?
✅ Alignment columns (§26.3) — FIXED width for anything meant to align across rows, not FILL —
   not yet automated, check by hand on any new token-sample table
✅ Screenshot at scale ≥ 2 (small crop) AND the REST `get_screenshot` tool if in doubt about a
   `node.screenshot()` result — cheap cross-check against a second rendering pipeline
```

### 26.11 A page must have exactly ONE `page-wrapper` — every content section is its CHILD, never a top-level sibling

> **Rule adopted 2026-07-30, corrected same day.** Trigger: consolidating two Icon pages into
> one, every section (`↳ Icons` header, `section-showcase`, `section-tokens`,
> `section-dos-donts`, `section-links`, a new `section-library`, `note`) was appended directly

> visible symptom (`#535353` canvas gray, §13, showing through the gap) but missed the actual
> defect: **every other page in this file has exactly ONE top-level `page-wrapper` frame
> containing ALL its content sections as children** (confirmed on `button`, `checkbox`, `input`,
> `top-nav` — each has `page-wrapper` + at most one clearly-separate off-canvas reference frame
> like `Composant principal`, never multiple live content sections loose at the page root).
> Width-matching alone is necessary but not sufficient — the structural containment is the real
> rule; a width check can still pass by coincidence while the page has no single wrapper at all.

```
✅ Exactly ONE top-level frame named `page-wrapper` (1440px, per §25) holds EVERY live content
   section as a CHILD — header, showcase, tokens, dos-donts, links, and any new section
✅ The only other top-level page children allowed are explicitly off-canvas, non-live material:
   a reference frame (e.g. `Composant principal`, `Exemple ...`, conventionally at x≥1600) or
   the `_trash` quarantine frame (§ "Never delete" in figma-library-governance.md) — never a
   second LIVE content section sitting beside `page-wrapper`
✅ When reparenting/moving a section onto a page (e.g. consolidating two pages into one),
   ALWAYS appendChild it into the page's `page-wrapper` — never `page.appendChild(node)`
   directly. If the page doesn't have a `page-wrapper` yet, create ONE first, move every
   existing top-level content section into it, THEN append the new section
✅ After any reparenting operation, run findMissingWrapper() and findWidthMismatches() (below)
   BEFORE screenshotting
❌ Never call `page.appendChild(node)` for a live content section — that is precisely how this
   incident happened; reserve bare `page.appendChild()` for the wrapper itself, `_trash`, or an
   explicitly off-canvas reference frame
❌ Never treat "all sections happen to be the same width" as proof the page is correctly built —
   width consistency is a symptom check, not the structural one
```

```javascript
// Audit sweep — run on every page: is there exactly one live page-wrapper?
// A "live" top-level child is anything not named `_trash`/starting with `_`, and not an
// off-canvas reference frame (x >= 1600, matching the site's `Composant principal` convention).
function findMissingWrapper(page) {
  const liveChildren = page.children.filter(c => c.visible !== false && !c.name.startsWith('_') && c.x < 1600);
  const wrappers = liveChildren.filter(c => /wrapper/i.test(c.name));
  if (wrappers.length === 1 && liveChildren.length === 1) return []; // exactly one wrapper, nothing else live
  return liveChildren
    .filter(c => !/wrapper/i.test(c.name))
    .map(c => ({ nodeId: c.id, nodeName: c.name, reason: wrappers.length === 0 ? 'no page-wrapper found — this node is a bare top-level sibling' : 'live content sitting beside page-wrapper instead of inside it' }));
}

// Secondary/symptom check — kept as a fallback signal, NOT a substitute for findMissingWrapper()
function findWidthMismatches(page) {
  const candidates = page.children.filter(c => c.visible !== false && !c.name.startsWith('_') && c.x < 1600 && 'width' in c);
  if (candidates.length < 2) return [];
  const counts = new Map();
  for (const c of candidates) counts.set(c.width, (counts.get(c.width) || 0) + 1);
  const mainWidth = [...counts.entries()].sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])[0][0];
  return candidates.filter(c => Math.abs(c.width - mainWidth) > 0.5)
    .map(c => ({ nodeId: c.id, nodeName: c.name, width: c.width, expectedWidth: mainWidth }));
}
```

> **`x < 1600` exclusion added 2026-07-30 (same-day fix):** without it, this check
> false-positives on every page's off-canvas master ComponentSet/`Composant principal`
> reference frame (per §16) — those are legitimately narrower than the page-wrapper and sit
> off-canvas by convention, not a containment bug. Match `findMissingWrapper()`'s exclusion.

Both are part of `scripts/figma/audit-figma-file.js` (`findMissingWrapper` + `findWidthMismatches`,
wired into `auditPage()` as `missingWrapper` + `widthMismatches`). `findMissingWrapper` is the
primary check — it catches the actual structural bug (no single container). `findWidthMismatches`
is a secondary signal that can catch a drift even when a wrapper exists (e.g. one child inside it
was never resized) but must never be relied on alone.

### 26.12 A `FIXED`-width `TEXT` child of an auto-layout instance silently ignores `.resize()` — use `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` instead

> **2026-09-01 incident.** Found fixing the overflow this session's `figma-component-page-checklist.md`
> test run surfaced: `button`'s `Spec frame` had 5 `section-*` frames resized from a stale `FIXED
> 1440` down to `FILL` (§25/§26.11-class fix, the section itself now correctly tracking its
> `1280`-wide parent). That shrink then exposed a second, nested defect — each section's
> `doc/section-header` instance was itself still `FIXED` at the old `1280` width, now overflowing
> its freshly-shrunk `1120`-wide parent. Setting the **instance**'s own
> `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` fixed that outer layer cleanly — but its single `TEXT` child
> (`SECTION TITLE`, `textAutoResize: 'NONE'`, `layoutSizingHorizontal: 'FIXED'`, width `1280`)
> kept reporting `width: 1280` afterward, still overflowing the now-`1120`-wide instance.

Two resize attempts on that `TEXT` child both failed **silently** — no thrown error, and the
width read back unchanged even in a **fresh, separate** `use_figma` call afterward (ruling out
the §26.4 stale-read-after-mutation caveat — this wasn't a caching artifact, the value genuinely
never changed):

```js
// ❌ Both of these no-op on a FIXED-width TEXT child of an auto-layout instance —
// no error thrown, node.width reads back unchanged even in a later, separate use_figma call
textNode.resize(1120, textNode.height);
textNode.resizeWithoutConstraints(1120, textNode.height);

// ✅ What actually works — treat it exactly like any other stale-FIXED-child overflow
// in this file (§28.4's scenario-title/caption FILL fix, §17's WRAP+FILL rows): switch
// the sizing MODE instead of trying to force a literal width onto a FIXED node
textNode.layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'; // width updates immediately, tracks the parent
```

```
✅ When a TEXT child of an auto-layout frame/instance is FIXED-width and overflows after its
   parent was resized, try layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL' FIRST — it is both the fix that
   actually works and the one consistent with every other FIXED→correct-width fix already
   documented in this file
❌ Never assume .resize()/.resizeWithoutConstraints() on a FIXED-width TEXT child will succeed
   just because no error is thrown — a silent no-op is possible, verify the new width with a
   fresh read (ideally a separate use_figma call, per §26.4) before trusting either call
❌ Don't mistake this for the §26.4 stale-geometry-read gotcha — that one is about trusting a
   read too early after a real mutation; this one is about the mutation itself never applying
```

Root cause not fully isolated (Figma's Plugin API gives no error to introspect), but the
practical rule holds regardless: for this class of "stale-FIXED-child-after-a-parent-resize"
overflow, reach for `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` before spending another call on `.resize()`.

## 27. Component spec panel — "Specs 2" format standard (token-name-first)

> **Rule adopted 2026-08-04**, direct user request. Trigger: the reference screenshot pasted

> 1094×19164 px — a full export from the Figma Community plugin **Specs 2**,

> for the small `doc/spec-panel` (§2.1 of `Temp/plan-redesign-figma-2026-07-23.md`, §1.6.7).
> This section formalizes the **entire** page structure the plugin produces as the target

### 27.0 The component set — built 2026-08-04, all on `↳ design annotations`

`doc/spec-panel` (Phase 1, id `618:23`) implements the diagram-plus-flat-token-list slice of
this format only (used on `button`/`checkbox`'s TOKENS USED section, 2026-08-03/04) — kept
as-is, still the right choice for a page's flat token summary table. For the fuller
Anatomy/Variant/State/Additional-variants/Props reproduction, five new reusable components now
exist, all on `↳ design annotations` (`584:4`), semantic-tokens-only, never published (§27.6):

| Component | Role | Reused/built from |
|---|---|---|
| `doc/annotation-badge` | Numbered circular marker, `Accent` variant (`Annotation`=`semantic.color.feedback.warning`, `Measurement`=`semantic.color.feedback.success`), `Number` text property | New — pill radius via `semantic.radius.pill` |
| `doc/property-row` | `layer-name` / `token-name` / `resolved-value` 3-line unit, `Label`/`Token`/`Value` text properties | Extracted from `doc/spec-panel`'s internal `layer-list` pattern |
| `doc/spec-group` | Swappable layer-type icon (`square`=container, `type`=text — real Lucide instances, imported by key, restroked to `semantic.color.text.secondary`) + bold `Name` + indented stack slot of `doc/property-row` | New — the "one layer, its overridden properties" unit shared by Anatomy/Variant/State/Additional-variants |
| `doc/variant-exhibit` | Gray `semantic.color.background.subtle` isolation box + real-instance slot + `Heading` + stack slot of `doc/spec-group` | New — the repeatable "one exhibit" row for Variant/State/Additional-variants sections |
| `doc/props-row` | `doc/eyebrow-tag` instance (Name chip) + Type/Default/Options text columns | New, reuses `doc/eyebrow-tag` for the Name chip |

**Found on `button`, 2026-08-31 — not previously documented, `badge`'s first Spec-frame build
missed all six.** Anatomy's pin diagram and Layout and spacing's measurement diagram are built
from a second family of `doc/*` components, also on `↳ design annotations`, not covered by the
5 above:

| Component | Role | Properties |
|---|---|---|
| `doc/annotation-badge` (reused here too) | The numbered pin itself, `Accent=Annotation` variant | `Number` (text) |
| `doc/measurement-badge` (id `956:3578`) | Small pill showing a dimension value next to a tick, `Accent=Measurement` styling | `Value` (text, e.g. `"16"`) |
| `doc/measurement-tick` (id `956:3580`) | A single thin dimension-line tick mark | none — resize the instance itself to the needed length/orientation |
| `doc/measurement-overlay` (id `956:3581`) | A translucent highlight bar marking the measured span (a padding region, a gap) | none — resize to the span being measured |
| `doc/selection-outline` (id `956:3582`) | Figma-native-looking blue selection rectangle around the whole instance or a sub-region | none — resize to the outlined bounds |
| `doc/hug-indicator` (ComponentSet, id `965:1153`) | Directional arrow(s) showing hug/fill sizing behavior | `Direction` variant: `top`/`down`/`top-down`/`left`/`right`/`left-right`/`horiz-to-center`/`vert-to-center` |
| `doc/auto-layout-icon` (ComponentSet, id `965:1221`) | The small alignment glyph (matches Figma's own auto-layout alignment icon) | `Property 2` variant: the 9 `top/middle/bottom`-`left/center/right` combinations, or `null` |

**Data section dropped from scope (2026-08-04, explicit user decision)** — Agentica does not
reproduce Specs 2's Data/JSON export. `tokens/*.json` (primitive → semantic → component) is
already the canonical, script-readable export of every token; a second hand-maintained JSON
blob per Figma page would duplicate it and drift. §27.2's structure and §27.3/§27.4's Data
subsection are kept below **only** as a faithful record of what the reference plugin produces
— skip that step when building a page's spec section, it is not part of Agentica's target
format.

**Also not yet built**: a dedicated `doc/layout-diagram` for the Layout-and-spacing section —
`doc/spec-group` already covers its property-list half; the alignment-glyph/padding-arrow
diagram half is still ad-hoc per page, same as an Anatomy diagram's badge positions always are
(§27.3, "bespoke per component, not a rigid reusable wrapper").

**A real bug found and fixed while building these**: `figma.createComponent()` returns a
plain frame with `layoutMode: NONE`. Wrapping an inner auto-layout frame inside it and
resizing the outer once at creation time works visually until the instance's content grows
(more property rows, longer text) — the outer `COMPONENT` never re-hugs because it has no
layout mode of its own, silently clipping content. Fix: never double-wrap — either make the
`COMPONENT` node itself the auto-layout container (set `layoutMode` directly on it, no inner
frame), or if an inner frame already exists, flatten it (copy the inner frame's layout
properties onto the outer `COMPONENT`, move its children up, remove the now-empty inner
frame) before calling the component "done". All 5 components above were fixed this way after
`doc/variant-exhibit`'s first test render clipped its property text.

### 27.1 Source of truth

Do not go back to a local screenshot path outside the repo — the exact same image already
lives in the Figma file itself, as node `539:1265` ("Exemple du plugin Specs 2") on the
`↳ button` page, off-canvas at `x=1600`. Re-inspect that node directly for any detail this
section doesn't cover.

### 27.2 Full page structure (top → bottom, fixed order)

```
1. Title                    — component name, large bold heading
2. Anatomy                  — annotated diagram(s) + numbered layer-property list
3. Props                    — summary table of every variant/property axis
4. Variant                  — one exhibit per variant option (root/default state)
5. State                    — one exhibit per state option (root/default variant)
6. Additional variants      — combined Variant×State exhibits that render differently
                               from the single-axis exhibits above
7. Layout and spacing       — auto-layout diagrams, one per state whose layout differs
```

> The reference plugin has an 8th section, Data (a generated JSON export) — **not part of
> Agentica's target format** (2026-08-04 decision, see §27.0): `tokens/*.json` already IS that
> export, canonically. Do not build it.

### 27.3 Section-by-section spec

#### Title
Component name only (e.g. "Button"), largest heading weight on the page — reuse
`doc/page-frame`'s `title` styling, not a new style.

#### Anatomy
One exhibit per **meaningful layer group** — not just leaf layers: the reference shows 4
(`root`, the `Button` text, the `pill` sub-container revealed only in the Focus state, and the
`Loading…` text swap), each its own gray canvas box (`#F2F2F2` background, hugging the real
component instance at natural size).

Per exhibit:
- The **real component instance**, never a redrawn mockup.
- A numbered circular badge (see §27.5 for the exact color) pinned to the callout target,
  connected by a thin straight line of the same color to a small leader dot at the anchor
  point on the instance.
- To the right, an ordered list matching each badge number:
  - Row header: a small type-glyph icon (frame glyph for a container/instance layer, `T`
    glyph for a text layer) + **layer name** in bold.
  - Indented property lines below, one per **explicitly overridden** property only — Figma's
    inherited defaults are never listed (this is why the reference's `Button` text entry shows
    6 lines while `Loading…` shows 15: only `Loading…` has letter-spacing/text-case/etc.
    explicitly set different from the layer's default). Applying this to Agentica: list only
    properties that are either variable-bound or explicitly set away from the component's own
    baseline — do not dump the full Plugin API surface for every layer.
  - Compound values (an `Effect`, a multi-stop gradient) get one line per sub-property,
    prefixed with a small "└" tree-connector glyph (see the Focus state's `DROP SHADOW`
    breakdown: `type` / `visible` / `offset x` / `offset y` / `blur` / `spread` / `color`).

> - The **real component instance** itself, once, shared by every pin (they all point at parts
>   of the same instance — do not duplicate the instance per pin)
>

> `doc/spec-group` property — append it into `header` directly, first child, after creating the

> every `doc/*` slot component).
>
> For a component with only 1–2 real layers (e.g. `badge`: `root`, optionally `icon`, `Label`),

#### Props
A 4-column summary table: `Name` (rendered as a small pill/chip, Figma's native "Variant"
property color) · `Type` · `Default` · `Options` (comma-separated enum values). One row per
variant/property axis — for Button: `Variant` and `State`.

#### Variant
H2 "Variant", then one H3 exhibit per variant option, each showing the variant at its default
state (`Primary`, `Secondary`, `Critical`, `Ghost`): gray canvas box with the real instance,
paired with the same layer-name + property-diff-from-baseline pattern as Anatomy — but scoped
to only the properties this variant changes relative to the root/`Primary` baseline (e.g.
`Ghost` only diffs `root.Background color` and `Button.Text color`; it never repeats
`Corner radius` since that never changes across variants).

#### State
Same treatment, mirrored on the `State` axis (`Default`, `Hover`, `Focus`, `Disabled`,
`Loading`), always shown on the baseline variant (`Primary`). `Focus` is the one state that
introduces a genuinely new layer (`pill`, the outer ring) — its exhibit adds a second
layer-property block for that new layer, not just a diff on `root`.

#### Additional variants
H2 + an explanatory line, reused near-verbatim from the plugin's own caption (keep this
caveat — it documents a real constraint, not filler copy): *"Variants below combine two or
more property configurations whose elements introduce additional styling or bindings beyond
the single-prop exhibits above. The order in which configurations are layered matters."*

Content: every `Variant × State` combination **except** `Primary` (already the baseline) and
`Default` (already the baseline state) — but only the combinations that actually render
differently from what's already shown. The reference itself already applies this filter: it
skips `Critical × Loading` (no visible delta over the single-axis exhibits) while including
every other non-baseline combination. **This is the exact same principle Agentica already
adopted for `doc/mode-frame` in §1.6.4 of the plan** ("un mode/variante n'est dupliqué <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim quote from the plan doc -->
visuellement que s'il produit un rendu réellement différent") — apply it identically here, it <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim quote from the plan doc -->
is not a new rule, just the same one reappearing in a new context.

#### Layout and spacing
H2, then one labeled auto-layout diagram per state whose **layout itself** (not just color)
differs — the reference shows `Default` and `State = Focus` (Focus changes the effective
bounding box via the outside-aligned focus stroke, everything else shares the default's
layout). Each diagram:
- A small alignment glyph + directional arrows indicating hug direction (horizontal/vertical).
- Green circular badges with a leader dimension-line, one per padding side that has a value
  (top/bottom/start/end) — omit a badge for a side whose padding is 0.
- A blue Figma-native "selection" outline instead of green badges when the diagram is only
  illustrating an **alignment** change with no padding to annotate (the `State = Focus`
  exhibit shows only `Alignment: Top center`, no padding badges, because Focus doesn't change
  padding — only what a screen reader/keyboard user's focus outline visually sits against).
- To the right: the same token-first property list — `Alignment`, `Direction`,
  `Vertical/Horizontal resizing`, `Padding top/bottom/start/end`, `Item spacing`.

>   overlay's length) at each end of the span, plus a `doc/measurement-badge` (`Value` = the
>   padding in px, e.g. `"16"`) centered on the overlay

#### Data — NOT built (2026-08-04 decision)
The reference plugin closes with a generated JSON export (`title`, `anatomy`, `props`,
`default`/`variants` layout+style diffs). **Agentica does not reproduce this section** —
`tokens/*.json` (primitive → semantic → component) is already the canonical, script-readable
export of every token in the system; a second hand-maintained-or-generated JSON blob per Figma
page would duplicate that source of truth and drift from it. Skip this step entirely when
building a page's spec section.

### 27.4 The universal token-first formatting rule

Applies to every property line in Anatomy, Variant, State, Additional variants, and Layout and
spacing:

```
Label: token.path.dotted (rawValue)
```

- `token.path.dotted` in the same teal/green accent `doc/spec-panel`'s `token-name` text node
  already uses (component-level token if one exists — §18 — else semantic).
- `rawValue` stays exactly as Specs 2 renders it (hex, `px`, `%`, keyword) — never omitted,
  the point is BOTH, not a replacement — **wrapped in parentheses**, not just set in a
  different color from the token (2026-08-29 correction, see the rule's intro note above:
  color alone isn't a sufficient distinction, WCAG 1.4.1). Parentheses are the minimum; a
  visually distinct style (e.g. lighter weight, monospace vs. the token's sans) on top of them
  is fine, but never a substitute for them.

**Properties with no token to attach stay exactly as Specs 2 shows them, unchanged** — this
covers content strings (`Text: Button`), enum/structural metadata with no token equivalent
(`Direction: Horizontal`, `Alignment: Middle left`, `layoutMode: HORIZONTAL`, `nullable`,
`detectedIn`), and font family names (the family string itself is the value, not a token
path — the *token* is what points AT `Atkinson Hyperlegible`, not a re-statement of it).

```
✅ Every color/dimension/radius/spacing/typography value that is Variable-bound in Figma
   (or has a corresponding component/semantic token in code) → token.path (rawValue)
✅ Structural/content/enum properties with no token equivalent → unchanged, raw only
❌ Never show a raw value alone when a token exists for it (defeats the whole point of §27)
❌ Never rely on color alone to distinguish the token from the raw value — parentheses are the
   minimum required distinction (2026-08-29, WCAG 1.4.1)
❌ Never invent a token path that doesn't exist in tokens/*.json — always look for an
   existing semantic token first (§27.5); only fall back to a primitive if genuinely none fits
❌ Never build a Data/JSON export section — tokens/*.json is already that export (2026-08-04)
```

**Real incident, 2026-08-05** — the Default exhibit on `button` documented `Alignment: Middle
center`. The real value, read directly off the node, is `Middle left`
(`primaryAxisAlignItems: 'MIN'`, `counterAxisAlignItems: 'CENTER'` on the HORIZONTAL root) —
caught by the user from the actual Figma properties panel, not by any agent-side check. Root
cause: enum/structural properties (`Alignment`, `Direction`, `Horizontal/Vertical resizing`)
have **no bound variable** to cross-check against, unlike color/spacing/typography — there is
nothing that throws an error or shows up in an `orphanedVariables` audit if the text is wrong.
It's easy to unconsciously default to a "looks right" value (a hugged component renders
identically whether its unused axis alignment is `MIN` or `CENTER`, so the bug is invisible in
every screenshot) instead of actually querying the property. **Rule: before writing any
`Direction`/`Alignment`/`*-resizing` line, read it directly off the real node**:

```js
node.layoutMode              // → Direction
node.primaryAxisAlignItems   // → Alignment (primary axis component)
node.counterAxisAlignItems   // → Alignment (counter axis component)
node.primaryAxisSizingMode   // → Horizontal/Vertical resizing (whichever is the primary axis)
node.counterAxisSizingMode   // → the other axis
```

Map primary/counter to horizontal/vertical based on `layoutMode` (`HORIZONTAL`: primary=X,
counter=Y; `VERTICAL`: primary=Y, counter=X) — don't reuse the reference screenshot's example
value for a different component, and don't infer alignment from how the component *looks*
when hugged, since MIN/CENTER/MAX are visually indistinguishable at hug size.

**Second half of the same incident, same day** — reading the real Figma node value is
necessary but **not sufficient**. The agent's first fix (`Middle center` → `Middle left`)
correctly matched what the Figma node said, but the Figma node itself was wrong: the real
Button master had `primaryAxisAlignItems: 'MIN'` on 16 of its 20 variants (every state except
`Focus`), while the shipped CSS (`components/agtc-button.js` line 121-123, the `button`
selector — the exact element `root` refers to in the Anatomy diagram, its children being
`icon-prefix`/`Button` text/`icon-suffix`) sets `align-items: center; justify-content: center`
on both axes. Per the standing code-is-source-of-truth governance
(`figma-library-governance.md`), this was a real product-component bug, not a documentation
bug — confirmed with the user (who asked one clarifying question first: is `Alignment` here
about the button's own internal content, or about the button as a child of some outer
container? — worth checking before assuming, since a Figma auto-layout alignment property can
describe either depending on which node you're reading it from) and fixed on the master
(all 16 variants set to `CENTER`), which is what made `Middle center` the correct final answer.

```
✅ Read the real Figma node property first (previous entry)
✅ THEN cross-check that value against the actual CSS/JS source before writing it into a spec
✅ If Figma and code disagree, that's a real component bug (governance: code wins) — surface
   it and get human confirmation before touching a shipped product master, same as any other
   Figma↔code divergence (§ the 6 divergences found 2026-08-04)
✅ Before comparing, confirm which node/selector "root" (or any labeled part) actually maps to
   in the code — an alignment/padding/gap property can describe content-within-element or
   element-within-parent depending on which frame you're reading
❌ Never treat "I read it off the real Figma node" as the end of verification — Figma can
   itself be the thing that's wrong
```

### 27.5 Visual chrome for reproducing this format — a dedicated annotation palette, never an Agentica product token

> **Superseded 2026-08-05** — the original version of this table reused Agentica's *product*
> semantic tokens (`semantic.color.feedback.warning`, `semantic.color.feedback.success`) for
> measurement/annotation chrome. Direct user instruction after reviewing a rendered Layout and
> spacing diagram: the green padding badges were visually indistinguishable from the button's
> own teal fill ("impossible à comprendre") — reusing a *product* hue for *documentation* <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim user quote -->
> chrome is a category error, not just a contrast problem. New standing rule:
>
> ```
> ✅ Design-note/annotation chrome uses ONLY the dedicated design-annotations palette (below)
> ❌ Never bind doc/* measurement, selection, or reference chrome to an Agentica product
>    semantic token (action/*, feedback/*, brand/*, etc.) — even if the hex value happens to
>    look distinct today, it's borrowed meaning from the product palette and can drift into
>    a collision the moment either palette changes
> ```

**The `design-annotations` Figma variable collection** (single mode, Figma-only — deliberately
**not** mirrored into `tokens/*.json`, since it must never compile into shipped CSS; nothing in
this collection is a product token):

| Variable | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `color/accent` | `#7C3AED` (vivid violet) | Fill for badges, ticks, selection outlines, connector lines — the one hue that carries zero meaning anywhere in Agentica's product palette (which already spans teal/action, red/danger, orange/warning, blue/info, pink/brand-accent — violet was the only unclaimed hue family) |
| `color/surface` | `#7C3AED` at 22% alpha (baked into the variable itself, not a separate paint-level opacity) | Translucent padding-zone / highlight overlays |
| `color/ink` | `#FFFFFF` | Text on filled badges |

> **Gotcha hit while building this**: setting `opacity` on a paint literal passed to
> `setBoundVariableForPaint()` gets silently dropped — the returned paint's opacity resets to
> 1. Fix: bake the alpha into the **variable's own color** (`{r,g,b,a}` on the variable value)
> instead of relying on a separate paint-level `opacity` field.

**Reusable components** (all on `↳ design annotations`, all bound to the palette above):

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `doc/measurement-badge` | Pill badge with a `Value` text property — the pixel-value label (e.g. "16", "8") for a padding/gap measurement |
| `doc/measurement-tick` | A resizable 1px line — bracket/boundary marks around a measured zone (rotate via instance resize, not a variant) |
| `doc/measurement-overlay` | Translucent rectangle (`color/surface`) — highlights the padding zone itself, resized/positioned per instance |
| `doc/selection-outline` | Stroke-only rectangle (`color/accent`) — the "this is the effective bounding box" indicator, resized per instance to match whatever is being measured |
| `doc/annotation-badge` | *(Phase 3 original)* numbered circular reference badge (Anatomy legend) — both variants (`Accent=Annotation`, `Accent=Measurement`) rebound from `feedback.warning`/`feedback.success` to `color/accent`, unifying every note type under one hue |

Gray canvas/isolation box background stays on the *product* semantic token
(`semantic.color.background.subtle`) — that's a neutral backdrop, not annotation content, so
the "never mix palettes" rule doesn't apply to it.

**2026-08-05 — user tuning + 2 more symbol components.** The user directly edited the
`design-annotations` variables in Figma (not via agent script): `color/accent` moved from the
agent's original violet (`#7C3AED`) to a magenta/pink (`#EE3AA6`); `color/surface` matches at
40% opacity (set as plain paint opacity this time, not baked into the variable — both work,
opacity-on-variable was only needed to work around the `setBoundVariableForPaint` gotcha above
when the agent needed opacity AND a variable-bound color in one call); font on
`doc/measurement-badge` changed to `Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono` (Medium) — consistent with the
Mono-scale precedent (§24) for other documentation-only text; a new `dimesions/radius` variable
(note: user's own naming, radius = 4) was added and bound to the badge's corner radius. None of
this needed reverting — components are bound to variables, so the agent's later work picked up
the new values automatically without any script changes.

Two more components added the same day, for the small meta-icons the reference plugin uses
(direction + hug-resizing indicators), on user request ("ajouter ces symboles pour aider la <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim user quote -->
compréhension") after being shown the reference's annotated screenshot a second time: <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim user quote -->

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `doc/auto-layout-icon` | Small grid glyph (3×3 subdivided square) + optional direction arrow, controlled by a boolean `Arrow` property — grid alone for a diagram that only shows alignment (e.g. State=Focus), grid+arrow when direction is relevant (e.g. Default) |
| `doc/hug-indicator` | Converging double-arrow (`Direction=Horizontal` / `Direction=Vertical` variants) — shows which axis is hugging its content |

Both bound to a new `color/meta` variable (neutral gray, `#6B6B6B`-ish) rather than
`color/accent` — these are **meta/utility** icons (auto-layout direction, resize behavior),
not measurement values, so they get their own neutral role in the palette rather than
competing visually with the pink measurement badges. Built via vector-path triangles rather
than rotated polygons — `figma.createPolygon()` rotation didn't behave predictably (position
math is relative to the unrotated bounding box, not the rendered one) and got clipped by the
parent frame; a hand-authored `vectorPaths` triangle avoids the rotation math entirely.

**Standing rule, applies to every `instance-slot` frame (master and every live instance,
current and future):** `clipsContent` must always be `false`. Direct user instruction
2026-08-05 — an `instance-slot` exists to host whatever real component instance is dropped
into it for a diagram, and clipping silently hides overflow (annotation lines/badges
positioned just outside the slot, or a real instance slightly larger than expected) with no
visual warning. Check this whenever building or auditing a `doc/variant-exhibit` (or similar)
instance.

> **Append target — into `instance-slot`, never as a sibling of it.** (2026-08-29 correction —
> the first `badge` build did `canvasBox.appendChild(instance)`, landing the real instance as
> a second, separate child of `canvas-box` alongside the still-empty, still-100×100
> `instance-slot` placeholder. Both rendered — the empty slot on top, the real instance below
> it, overlapping — because `canvas-box` is itself `VERTICAL` auto-layout with
> `CENTER`/`CENTER` alignment and no error is thrown either way; this is a silent layout
> defect, not a script failure.) `canvas-box`'s pristine `instance-slot` child ships empty and
> `HUG`-sized (`primaryAxisSizingMode`/`counterAxisSizingMode: AUTO`) — find it explicitly
> (`canvasBox.children.find(c => c.name === 'instance-slot')`) and `appendChild` the real
> instance **into it**, not into `canvas-box` directly. `instance-slot` then auto-hugs to the
> instance's real size (verified on `button`: a 76×38 `Button` instance → a 76×38
> `instance-slot`, not the empty 100×100 default), and `canvas-box` auto-hugs around that.

### 27.6 Where these components live — `↳ design annotations` only, never published

> **Rule adopted 2026-08-04**, direct user instruction. Applies to every component whose sole
> purpose is presenting/documenting a Figma file — page headers, eyebrow tags, section
> titles, status badges, anatomy/spec-panel chrome, DO/DON'T card chrome, mode-comparison
> frames — i.e. the entire `doc/*` family, current and future, no exceptions.

```
✅ Build and host EVERY doc/* presentation component on ↳ design annotations (page 584:4,
   under ❖ UTILITY) — the single canonical location, not a separate page
✅ Bind every doc/* component to semantic tokens (§27.5) — never a primitive directly, never
   a hardcoded value (same baseline rule as any other component, tokens-system.md)
✅ Never publish doc/* with the library — same discipline already established for the Mono
   typography scale (§24) and Figma-only chrome in general
❌ Never create a new page (e.g. a second "doc-components"-style page) to host presentation
   components — consolidate, don't fragment
❌ Never bind a doc/* component to a primitive when an existing semantic token already
   matches (§27.5) — check tokens/semantic.json before reaching for tokens/primitives.json
```

**Migration executed 2026-08-04**: the 10 Phase-1 `doc/*` masters (`doc/eyebrow-tag`,
`doc/section-header`, `doc/token-row`, `doc/type-ramp-row`, `doc/status-badge`,
`doc/page-frame`, `doc/dos-donts-card`, `doc/mode-frame`, `doc/spec-panel`,
`doc/color-swatch`) were built on a since-retired page, `↳ doc-components` — a Phase 1
deviation from the original plan (`Temp/plan-redesign-figma-2026-07-23.md` §1.6.1), which had
always designated `↳ design annotations` for exactly this purpose (originally scoped to the
Mono typography scale only, §1.6.1/§3 Q2). All 10 masters were moved via `page.appendChild()`
to `↳ design annotations` (`584:4`) — node IDs unchanged, so every live instance already
placed on `button` and `checkbox` stayed correctly linked (moving a master's page never
breaks an instance's `mainComponent` reference — verified by screenshot on both pages after
the move). The now-empty source page was renamed
`_deprecated — doc-components (empty, migrated to ↳ design annotations 2026-08-04)` rather
than deleted (no-delete rule, `figma-library-governance.md` §A) — flagged for the human to
delete manually once confirmed no longer needed.

## 28. Page architecture — the 3-frame `doc/frame-header` pattern (component page completion contract)

> **Rule adopted 2026-08-29**, direct user request, after a documentation-gap incident found
> while building the `badge` page. Distinct from §27: §27 defines the *content* format of the
> "Specs 2" documentation block; this section defines the *outer container* architecture every
> component page is built in, and the completion criterion that makes a page "done".

### 28.0 Discovery incident — why this section exists

`badge` (2026-08-29) was first built using the pre-Phase-3 flat `page-wrapper` pattern — the
convention used by 8 of the file's then-10 component pages (checkbox, feature-card, icon,
input, radio, segmented, tabs, toggle, top-nav). `button` — the lone Phase 3 pilot
(2026-08-03) — was already using a completely different, undocumented 3-frame architecture.
Confirmed missing at every level before writing this section: this file (§27 covers content
only, never this outer structure), `Temp/plan-redesign-figma-2026-07-23.md` §1.6.3 (describes
the *intent* for a distinctive header, never the pattern actually built), every session
memory, and even the `doc/frame-header` component's own Figma `description` field (empty).
Reverse-engineered directly from `button` live in the file, then confirmed with the user.

### 28.1 The 3 top-level frames

Every component page is exactly 3 top-level frames (plus, where relevant, an off-canvas
reference screenshot and `_trash`/`_OLD_...` remnants — see §28.5). No other top-level content.

| Frame | Purpose | `doc/frame-header` `Where` variant |
|---|---|---|
| `Main frame` | Marketing-style page header + variant showcase + best practices + references | `main-frame` |
| `Main-component frame` | The live, editable master ComponentSet, displayed inline | `main-component-frame` |
| `Spec frame` | The full Specs 2 documentation (§27) — Anatomy/Props/Variant/State/Additional variants/Layout and spacing | `specs-frame` |

Each of the 3 frames is itself `layoutMode: VERTICAL` auto-layout, 1440px wide, stacking
`doc/frame-header` (header) → `body` → `footer` as direct children — no extra wrapper.

> **Positioning — horizontal, not stacked. Read this before placing the 3 frames, every
> single time.** (2026-08-29, recurring mistake — flagged by the user after it happened
> again on `badge`, having already been corrected once before without it being written
> down anywhere, which is exactly why it recurred.)
>
> The 3 frames sit **side by side on one row**, not stacked one above another. Verified
> against `button`'s real, live coordinates:
>
> | Frame | `x` | `y` | `width` |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | `Main frame` | `0` | `0` | `1440` |
> | `Main-component frame` | `1800` | `0` | `1440` |
> | `Spec frame` | `3600` | `0` | `1440` |
>
> **`y` is `0` for all 3 — never increment it.** The horizontal gap between each frame's
> right edge and the next one's left edge is **exactly 360px** (`x` of the next frame =
> previous frame's `x` + `width` + `360`; with every frame 1440px wide that's a fixed
> `1800` stride: `0`, `1800`, `3600`, …). This is a general layout convention for any set
> of full-page frames placed side by side in this file, not a one-off constant invented
> for these 3 frames specifically — the user confirmed the same 360px figure via a
> reference screenshot titled (translated) "Page/template layout within each Figma page";
> its source location inside the file has not been independently located/confirmed.
>
> ```
> ✅ mainFrame.x = 0;         mainFrame.y = 0;
> ✅ mainCompFrame.x = mainFrame.x + mainFrame.width + 360;   mainCompFrame.y = 0;
> ✅ specFrame.x = mainCompFrame.x + mainCompFrame.width + 360;   specFrame.y = 0;
> ❌ Never stack them vertically (mainCompFrame.y = mainFrame.height, etc.) — that was
>    the exact mistake made building badge, caught only by visual review, not by any
>    audit script (a vertically-stacked page still passes every binding/token check —
>    this is a pure layout-convention error, invisible to `audit-figma-file.js`)
> ❌ Never leave a frame at Figma's default (0,0) drop position without setting both x
>    AND y explicitly — silently inheriting (0,0) is how two frames end up overlapping
> ```

### 28.2 `doc/frame-header` — the component

ComponentSet on `↳ design annotations` (id `1062:1207`), variant property `Where` (3 options:
`main-frame` / `main-component-frame` / `specs-frame`, each a different height/visual
treatment), plus 6 TEXT properties always present regardless of variant: `Eyebrow`, `Tech ID`,
`Title`, `Subtitle`, `Heading`, `Description` — not every property is visually rendered by
every `Where` variant, but all 6 must still be set explicitly on every instance (the component
silently ignores the ones its variant doesn't render; leaving them at the default is how the
`"SYS-XXX-00"`/`"Page title"` placeholder leaks into a real page).

```
✅ Eyebrow — page category, e.g. "COMPONENTS"
✅ Tech ID — e.g. "· CMP-BDG-01" (3-letter component code, sequential number)
✅ Title / Subtitle — used by the main-frame variant (page title + one-sentence purpose)
✅ Heading / Description — used by main-component-frame and specs-frame variants
   (component name + purpose, repeated because each frame is scrollable/shareable on its own)
❌ Never leave a property at its default placeholder value ("Page title", "SYS-XXX-00")
```

Carries its own dark, teal-glow branded chrome (the Agentica identity treatment referenced in
the plan's §1.6.3) — do not restyle it, it's a single reusable master.

### 28.3 `doc/section-header` — section labels, everywhere

Every section inside every frame (`section-presentation`, `section-dos-donts`,
`section-links`/`doc/footer`, and each subsection label inside `Spec frame`'s body) uses a
`doc/section-header` instance (id `604:4`, `↳ design annotations`) instead of a raw
`typography/mono/detail` text node. This **replaces** the pre-Phase-3 convention (plain
mono-detail label text, still visible on the 8 not-yet-migrated pages): new pages use
`doc/section-header` exclusively, never a raw label text node, and never a manually-detached
copy of it (see the gotcha below).

> **Corrected by the user 2026-08-31 — verified live, both structure and style changed from
> the description previously written here.** The master has **no exposed component
> properties** (`componentPropertyDefinitions` is `{}`) — set the title by finding the child
> `TEXT` node directly and writing `.characters`, there is no `Title#...` property to call
> `setProperties()` with. Structurally, the old hand-built underline (a separate `Rectangle`
> child, sized/positioned by hand under the text) is gone: the master itself now carries a
> real **bottom-only stroke** (`strokeBottomWeight: 1`, `strokeTopWeight`/`Left`/`Right: 0`,
> `strokeAlign: INSIDE`, color `semantic/color/border/focus`) — a single child (`SECTION
> TITLE`, the `TEXT` node) is all a correct instance ever has. Style-wise, the old
> "small on Main frame, Bold 40px override on Spec frame" split described here previously is
> **gone** — the master's own default is now uniformly `Atkinson Hyperlegible Bold 40px`,
> color `semantic/color/text/secondary`, and every real instance checked across both pages
> (`Main frame`, `Main-component frame`, `Spec frame`, `doc/footer`'s `REFERENCES`) renders at
> that one size with **no per-instance override needed at all**. Do not reintroduce a
> font-size override — if a title looks small, the instance is stale (see below), not
> under-styled.

```js
const sectionHeaderComp = /* fetch id 604:4 from ↳ design annotations */;
const inst = sectionHeaderComp.createInstance();
parent.appendChild(inst);
const titleText = inst.children.find(c => c.type === 'TEXT');
titleText.characters = 'BEST PRACTICES';
// No setProperties() call, no font/size/color override — the master default is correct as-is.
```

> **Gotcha found rebuilding `button`'s 6 stale `Spec frame` headers (2026-08-31)**: every
> section-header instance built *before* the user's master correction above stayed on the
> **old** structure (`SECTION TITLE` + `Rectangle` child) even after the master changed,

> not patched in place.

### 28.4 Frame-by-frame body composition (from `button`, the only page built this way as of 2026-08-29)

**`Main frame`** body/footer, in order:
1. `section-presentation` — `doc/section-header` (e.g. "ALL VARIANTS") + the variant showcase
   (real instances) +, on `button`, a `mode-comparison` Light/Dark diff block and an
   `icon-variants` block — component-specific, build what's relevant to the component at hand
2. `section-dos-donts` — `doc/section-header` ("BEST PRACTICES") + `dos-row` × N, each row 2
   real `doc/dos-donts-card` instances (ComponentSet id `616:254`, `↳ design annotations`,
   variant `State`: `DO`/`DON'T`, icons `thumbs-up`/`thumbs-down`) — **not** the pre-Phase-3
   `do-column`/`dont-column` hand-built frames. (2026-08-29 correction: the first `badge`
   build reused the old hand-built pattern instead of this real component — see §28.7.)
   The card's `header` [icon + `DO`/`DON'T` label] is fixed; only `wrapper`'s `scenario-title`
   TEXT, `caption` TEXT, and `example-slot` (append a real component instance, wrapped in your
   own `example-visual` auto-layout frame — the pristine master's `example-slot` starts empty,
   it is not a component-property slot) are populated per instance. `scenario-title`/`caption`
   default to a narrow `FIXED` width inherited from the master — set both to
   `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` after populating, or text wraps after 1–2 words.
3. `footer` → a `doc/footer` instance (§28.4bis) with its `links-row` populated for this frame

**`Main-component frame`** body/footer:
1. `body` → a single frame named `"[component] (copy for display)"` containing: a heading TEXT
   (component name) and **a real, well-structured, borderless table of every variant** — never
   a raw `ComponentSet` dropped in as-is with a `Variant=.../State=...` legend line instead of
   real headers (that was `button`'s state until 2026-08-31, corrected below). Despite the
   frame's name, `"(copy for display)"` **is** a literal duplicate `ComponentSet` in practice —
   `button` has two separate `ComponentSet`s both named `"Button"` in the file (`1055:778`,
   this display copy; `380:2`, the real master the rest of the page's instances point to) — the
   name is not a guarantee of there being only one; check with `page.findAll(n => n.type ===
   'COMPONENT_SET' && n.name === '[Component]')` before assuming which one a given table's
   cells derive from.
   - **The real table pattern** (verified on `badge`'s `Main-component frame`, and rebuilt onto
     `button`'s on 2026-08-31): reuse the exact same real, already-correct table structure the
     page's own `section-presentation` uses for its variant/state matrix — a `variant-grid` (or
     equivalent) frame of `header-row` (column labels, e.g. `Default`/`Hover`/`Focus`/
     `Disabled`/`Loading`) + one `row-*` per row (a `row-label` TEXT + one `cell-*` frame per
     column, each wrapping a real component **instance**, `fills: []`/`strokes: []` throughout
     the row/cell/header wrapper frames — the only visible strokes left are the component's own
     intentional state styling, e.g. a focus ring, never a table border). Cloning the page's
     existing correct grid (`sourceGrid.clone()`) and dropping the clone into `body` is the
     fastest reliable way to get this exactly right — it reuses proven alignment instead of
     re-deriving spacing/positioning by hand.
   - `button`'s old raw `ComponentSet` copy (`1055:778`) was parked per §28.5's no-delete
     precedent: renamed `_OLD_Button (copy for display, superseded by real header-row/row-label
     table, 2026-08-31)`, moved to the page root (not left nested inside the still-live
     auto-layout `body` frame — an auto-layout parent ignores a hidden child's `x`/`y` and keeps
     rendering it inline, so `appendChild` onto the **page**, then set `x`/`y` far off-canvas)
   - ❌ Do not use `ComponentSet.layoutMode = 'GRID'` (Figma's native variant-grid auto-layout,
     seen on `badge`'s table) for a component whose per-state cell widths vary a lot (e.g.
     `button`'s `Loading…` cells are visibly wider than `Button`) — the paired column/row label
     frames only align by eye-tuned fixed spacing, which can silently drift out of sync with
     the grid's real (auto-sized) column widths. The `header-row`/`row-label`/fixed-width-`cell`
     pattern above is unaffected by this since every cell wrapper has an explicit width.
   - **Row/column label style — corrected 2026-08-31, verify on every table.** Every axis
     label (row labels — `Primary`/`Secondary`/… — and column headers — `Default`/`Hover`/…, or
     `badge`'s `Neutral`/`Brand`/… and `Sm`/`Md`) is `weight: Regular`, color
     `semantic/color/text/secondary`. `button`'s `variant-grid` (both the `section-presentation`
     source and the `Main-component frame` clone, Light **and** Dark) originally had row-labels
     in `Bold` + `semantic/color/action/primary` (the brand teal) — an accent color has no
     semantic reason to be on a plain axis label, and it doesn't match `badge`'s row/column
     labels (which were already the correct gray, just still `Bold`, also corrected here). Fix
     both properties on every row/column label text node found — `fontName.style` and, if bound
     to anything other than `text/secondary`, `fills` (rebind via
     `figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(paint, 'color', secondaryVar)`, never a literal
     hex). A `variant-grid` cloned from a still-wrong source inherits the wrong style — fix the
     source first, or fix every clone independently, never assume one fix propagates to the other
     (clones are plain duplicated frames, not instances of a shared master).
   - **Dark mode has its own copy too — check it separately.** `section-presentation`'s
     `mode-comparison` holds two independent `variant-table`/`variant-grid` frames (`Light` and
     `Dark`, each its own `doc/mode-frame`), not one table re-skinned by a mode toggle. Fixing
     the `Light` copy's row/column labels does not touch the `Dark` copy — verified 2026-08-31:
     `badge`'s `Dark` table headers were still `Bold` after the `Light` one was fixed. Resolved
     colors were checked numerically too, not just eyeballed: `semantic/color/text/secondary`
     in Dark mode against the `doc/mode-frame` Dark wrapper's real fill
     (`semantic/color/background/page` in dark mode, confirmed the same bound variable on both
     `badge` and `button`) is 8.47:1 — comfortably past WCAG AA (4.5:1) for normal text.
2. `footer` → a `doc/footer` instance (same pattern)

**`Spec frame`** body/footer, verified against `button`'s real live structure (2026-08-29 —
the first `badge` build got this wrong: everything was dumped as flat siblings directly into
`body`, no per-subsection wrapper, exhibits laid out `WRAP`/side-by-side instead of stacked):

1. `body` → **one `section-[name]` frame per §27 subsection** — `section-anatomy`,
   `section-props`, `section-variant`, `section-state` (rename to the component's real second
   axis when it has no interactive states — e.g. `section-size` for a component whose only
   other property is a size scale, as on `badge`; add a short explanatory TEXT note right
   after that section's `doc/section-header` so a reader knows it's a deliberate adaptation,
   not a mistake), `section-additional-variants`, `section-layout-spacing`.
   Each `section-*` frame: `layoutMode: VERTICAL`, `itemSpacing: 32`, padding
   `top:60 bottom:60 left:80 right:80`, width `FILL` (1440 in practice), **no fill of its own**
   (2026-08-31, final simplification — see §28.4ter: the fill lives once, on the top-level
   frame itself; every section inside is transparent and lets it show through). `doc/frame-header`
   is the one exception — it keeps its own branded `semantic/color/background/inverse` chrome.
   Each `section-*` frame's direct children: `doc/section-header` (the subsection title) →
   optional explanatory TEXT (e.g. the "Additional variants" caveat copy, or an adaptation
   note) → `exhibit-stack`.
2. `exhibit-stack` — `layoutMode: VERTICAL` (**not** `HORIZONTAL`/`WRAP` — exhibits stack one
   below another, full-width, never side by side), `itemSpacing: 48`, built with the 5 `doc/*`
   components from §27.0 (`doc/annotation-badge`, `doc/property-row`, `doc/spec-group`,
   `doc/variant-exhibit`, `doc/props-row`) — see §28.6, this is not optional.
3. `footer` → a `doc/footer` instance (§28.4bis)

### 28.4bis `doc/footer` — the component

> Created by the user 2026-08-31 (node `1221:3907`, `↳ design annotations`, plain `COMPONENT`)
> after an earlier agent-built version (superseded, renamed `_OLD_doc/footer`, left in place
> per the no-delete rule — never instantiate it going forward). Applied to all 3 footers on
> both `badge` and `button`. Started with **no exposed properties** (content set by reaching
> into named children); given real Component Properties the same day, after the fixes below —
> see "Component Properties" further down, that is now the correct way to set link content.

Structure: `doc/footer` (root, `fills: none`) → `wrapper` (the only real fill in the whole
component — bound to `semantic/color/background/subtle`, a deliberate exception to §28.4ter's
"sections carry no fill" rule, since a footer is a distinct closing band, not a content
section) → `doc/section-header` instance (`Title` = "REFERENCES") → `links-row` (`layoutMode:
HORIZONTAL`, 5 link-pill slots — `link-guidelines`, `link-nn-g-icons-indicators`,
`link-wcag-1-1-1`, `link-slot-5`, `link-tokens` — pill `fills: semantic/color/background/surface`,
`strokes: semantic/color/border/focus` 1px, `cornerRadius: 100`, link text same color as the
stroke). `link-slot-5` is a generic, always-`visible: true` on the master extra slot added
2026-08-31 so a page needing a 5th reference link (button: Guidelines/NN·g/WCAG 1.4.3/
WCAG 2.5.8/Tokens) can use it — see the gotcha below for why it defaults to visible rather than
hidden.

> **First attempt on this page was wrong and got corrected the same day**: the 3 badge + 3
> button footers were first built by creating a `doc/footer` instance and immediately
> `detachInstance()`-ing it to swap in each frame's real links — this produced 6 plain
> `FRAME` nodes with no live link back to the component at all, which is what the user flagged

```
✅ Create a plain instance — never detach it — even when a frame's link content differs
✅ Set link content via setProperties() (see "Component Properties" below) — the current,
   correct way, as of the same day these properties were added
✅ Leave "REFERENCES" as the section title unless a frame genuinely needs a different one
✅ After building, verify with getMainComponentAsync() that every footer instance's main
   component id is `1221:3907` — a detached copy silently passes a visual review
❌ Never detach a doc/footer instance to edit its content — that is exactly the mistake made
   and corrected on 2026-08-31; use setProperties() instead
❌ Never instantiate `_OLD_doc/footer` — it is superseded, kept only per the no-delete rule
❌ Never strip wrapper's `background/subtle` fill to match §28.4ter — footer is the deliberate
   exception, not an oversight
```

#### Component Properties — set link content at instance creation, not by reaching into children

> Added 2026-08-31, same day, right after the fix above — the user asked whether link content
> could be set "at each component's creation" rather than by finding named children by hand.
> Verified working, both on a fresh test instance and retroactively on all 6 already-existing
> real footer instances (component-property references defined on the master apply to
> instances that existed before the properties were added — no rebuild needed).

`doc/footer` (`1221:3907`) exposes 6 component properties:

| Property key | Type | Bound to |
|---|---|---|
| `Link 1 label#1296:0` | TEXT | `link-guidelines`'s TEXT `.characters` |
| `Link 2 label#1296:1` | TEXT | `link-nn-g-icons-indicators`'s TEXT `.characters` |
| `Link 3 label#1296:2` | TEXT | `link-wcag-1-1-1`'s TEXT `.characters` |
| `Show link 4#1296:3` | BOOLEAN | `link-slot-5`'s `.visible` |
| `Link 4 label#1296:4` | TEXT | `link-slot-5`'s TEXT `.characters` |
| `Link 5 label#1296:5` | TEXT | `link-tokens`'s TEXT `.characters` |

```js
const inst = master.createInstance(); // master = the doc/footer component (1221:3907)
parent.insertChild(idx, inst);
inst.setProperties({
  'Link 1 label#1296:0': '↗ Guidelines',
  'Link 2 label#1296:1': '↗ NN/g — Buttons',
  'Link 3 label#1296:2': '↗ WCAG 1.4.3',
  'Show link 4#1296:3': true, // false hides the 5th pill entirely for a 4-link page
  'Link 4 label#1296:4': '↗ WCAG 2.5.8',
  'Link 5 label#1296:5': '↗ Tokens',
});
```

```
✅ Set every link via setProperties() in one call, right after createInstance() — no need to
   walk into wrapper/links-row/link-* children by name anymore
✅ Set 'Show link 4' explicitly even when leaving it at the default — makes the 4-vs-5-link
   choice visible in the script instead of relying on the master's current default
✅ This is also now editable directly in the Figma UI Properties panel, not script-only
❌ Don't mix the old and new pattern — since the properties exist, never reach into
   linksRow.children.find(...) and set .characters/.visible directly again; use setProperties()
❌ Property keys are file-specific generated ids (`#1296:N`) — re-verify with
   `master.componentPropertyDefinitions` before reusing this snippet in a script, don't assume
   the numbers stay `1296:0`…`1296:5` forever if the master is ever rebuilt
```

#### The link pills need a real Figma hyperlink too — the label text alone isn't a link

> Found 2026-09-01: `setProperties()` (above) sets the visible **label** text, but a Figma
> `TEXT` node's actual clickable hyperlink is a **separate** property (`.hyperlink`) that
> `setProperties()`/`componentPropertyReferences` does not touch. A pill can render perfectly —
> icon, correct label, correct color — and still not be an actual link. In Figma, a hyperlink
> can only be attached to text (a whole `TEXT` node's `.hyperlink`, or a sub-range via
> `.setRangeHyperlink()`), never to a frame/pill wrapper — set it on the `TEXT` child inside
> each `link-*` cell, not on the cell frame.

```js
const textNode = cell.children.find(c => c.type === 'TEXT');
textNode.hyperlink = { type: 'URL', value: 'https://example.com' };
// { type: 'NODE', value: nodeId } also works, for a link to another node/page in the same file
// (see ↳ lucide icons' "Icon component" link, id 798:9, for a real example of that form).
```

Real URLs used on every footer instance (never invented — each one either already existed as a
precedent elsewhere in this file, or is the exact citation already committed in this
component's own `guidelines/components/*.md`, the actual source of truth for these claims):

| Link label | URL | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `Guidelines` | `github.com/…/agentica-design-system/blob/main/guidelines/components/badge.md` (or `button.md`) | the component's own guideline **file**, not the shared folder |
| `Tokens` | `github.com/…/agentica-design-system/blob/main/tokens/component.json#L178` (badge) / `#L10` (button) | the component's own top-level key **inside** the one shared `component.json`, via a GitHub line anchor — there is no per-component tokens file |
| `NN/g — Icons & Indicators` (badge) | `nngroup.com/articles/indicators-validations-notifications/` | the citation already used in `guidelines/components/banner.md`, which states its own indicator guidance is "Aligned with `agtc-badge`" — topic-specific, not the generic hub page |
| `NN/g — Buttons` (button) | `nngroup.com/articles/command-links/` | already this file's own `§10 Mandatory links` "Typical call (Button example)" — that pre-existing illustrative snippet had the right idea, this instance just wasn't wired to match it yet |
| `WCAG 1.1.1` (badge) | `w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html` | same URL already cited in `guidelines/components/image.md` |
| `WCAG 1.4.3` / `WCAG 2.5.8` (button) | `w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html` / `…/target-size-minimum.html` | the official W3C "Understanding" page for that success criterion, same domain/path pattern as the 1.1.1 precedent above |

> **Corrected 2026-09-01** — first pass used the generic **folder** (`tree/main/guidelines`) for
> `Guidelines` and the generic NN/g hub page (`design-pattern-guidelines/`, reused verbatim

```
✅ Set .hyperlink on the TEXT node inside the cell, never on the cell/pill frame
✅ Reuse a URL that already exists somewhere real in the file or the repo's own guidelines/*.md
   citations — search for precedent (figma.root findAll TEXT nodes with a non-mixed .hyperlink,
   or grep the whole repo, not just guidelines/components/, for nngroup.com/w3.org — the more
   specific precedent for `NN/g — Buttons` above was sitting in this very file's §10, and the
   more specific `NN/g` precedent for badge was in banner.md, not badge.md itself)
✅ Prefer the most specific real target over a generic one: a component's own guideline file
   over the shared guidelines folder, a line anchor into component.json over the bare file,
   a named topic-specific article over a generic hub page — always still a real, existing URL
❌ Never invent a URL, even a plausible-looking one (a guessed NN/g article slug, a made-up
   WCAG page) — the W3C "Understanding" URLs are safe to use directly (one stable, well-known
   path pattern per success criterion), but an NN/g article slug is not guessable reliably
❌ Don't assume setProperties() covers hyperlinks — it only reaches whatever the master's
   componentPropertyReferences actually map (here: text characters and one slot's visibility),
   hyperlink is always a separate, per-instance step
```

#### Gotcha: `createInstance()` can silently drop a child that was *just* made visible

`figma.createInstance()` on a component whose child was set to `visible: true` in an *earlier,
separate* `use_figma` call can still produce a fresh instance missing that child entirely — the
component-definition sync that `createInstance()` reads from appears to lag by one call
boundary. Symptom: no error, but the new instance's `linksRow.children.length` (or equivalent)
is short one node, and there is no way to reveal it after the fact (it was never created)
— the same failure shape as the pre-existing `feedback_figma_createinstance_drops_invisible_children`
memory, but triggered here by a *very recently* toggled child, not only a permanently-hidden
one. Also: setting `.visible = false` on a newly created instance's own auto-layout child can
prune that child out of `.children` entirely rather than leaving it present-but-hidden — treat
this as equivalent to "not needed on this instance," not as a bug to fight; it produces the
correct visual/structural result (4 clean pills, no dead hidden node) and the node still reads
back as a genuine `INSTANCE` of the master.

```
✅ Toggle a master child's default visibility, THEN create every instance that needs the new
   default in the SAME script call (not a later, separate use_figma call) — verify inline with
   a throw-on-missing check (`if (!slot) throw new Error(...)`) before trusting the result
✅ Treat a hidden-then-pruned auto-layout child on a fresh instance as expected, not broken —
   confirm visually/structurally instead of asserting on children.length alone
❌ Never assume a component edit from a previous use_figma call is already visible to
   createInstance() in the next call — re-verify in the same call that creates the instances
❌ Never conclude an instance is "broken" just because children.length is lower than the
   master's — check whether the difference is an intentional hide-and-prune override first
```

### 28.4ter Frame backgrounds — one fill, on the top-level frame only

> **2026-08-31, direct user instruction, applied to both `badge` and `button`.** Earlier in
> the same day, section backgrounds were first made to alternate (`surface`/`subtle`,
> §28.4's original text), then corrected to a uniform `background/page` **on every section**
> — both superseded by this final, simpler rule.

**Only the 3 top-level frames (`Main frame`, `Main-component frame`, `Spec frame`) carry a
fill — `semantic/color/background/page` (`#FCFCFC`), each. Every section, `body`, `Spec
content (copy for display)` wrapper, and any other descendant frame inside carries `fills: []`
(empty) and lets the top-level frame's fill show through.** `doc/frame-header` keeps its own
`semantic/color/background/inverse` chrome — untouched, it's a distinct branded component, not
a plain content section. `doc/footer`'s `wrapper` also keeps its own `background/subtle` fill
(§28.4bis) — the one other deliberate exception.

```
✅ mainFrame.fills = [bound to background/page]; every child section: child.fills = []
✅ Same for Main-component frame and Spec frame, including sections nested 2 levels deep
   (button's "Spec content (copy for display)" wrapper AND its 6 section-* children — both
   need clearing, not just the direct child of body)
❌ Never bind background/page (or any color) on a section/body/wrapper frame — only the 3
   top-level frames carry a fill
❌ Never clear doc/frame-header's or doc/footer's own fills — both are the documented exceptions
```

### 28.5 Migrating a page from the old pattern — no-delete precedent

`button`'s migration (2026-08-03) did not delete the pre-Phase-3 `page-wrapper`/off-canvas
`Main component` — it renamed them `_OLD_Main component (copied into Main-component frame)`
and moved the real ComponentSet OUT of it into the new `Main-component frame` → `body` →
`"[name] (copy for display)"`, leaving the old wrapper as an emptied, clearly-labeled remnant
per `figma-library-governance.md` §A (never delete). Apply the same when migrating any page:

```
✅ Rename the emptied old wrapper(s) "_OLD_[original name] (superseded by [new frame name])"
✅ Move it far off-canvas (e.g. x=6000) so it doesn't interfere with the new reading flow
✅ Move (not clone) the real master ComponentSet into the new structure — there is only one master
❌ Never delete the old wrapper, even once its content has been moved out
```

### 28.6 Completion criterion — when is a component page "done"?

> **A component page is only considered complete once its `Spec frame` correctly displays the
> full Specs 2 content for that component (§27 — Anatomy, Props, Variant, State, Additional
> variants, Layout and spacing) — not a placeholder, not a partial substitute like a bare
> tokens table.** (2026-08-29, explicit user decision.)

This means, as of 2026-08-29:
- **`button` is the only page in the file that meets this bar.**
- **`badge`, built earlier the same day, does not** — its `Spec frame` currently holds only
  the 26-row `TOKENS USED` table (the pre-Phase-3 `section-tokens` content, moved as-is), not
  the full 7-section Specs 2 breakdown. It stays "En attente" in GitHub Projects, not <!-- lang-audit-ignore: literal GitHub Projects Status field value -->
  "Terminé", until the full `Spec frame` content is built. <!-- lang-audit-ignore: literal GitHub Projects Status field value -->
- **The 8 other existing pages** (checkbox, feature-card, icon, input, radio, segmented, tabs,
  toggle, top-nav) still use the pre-Phase-3 flat `page-wrapper` pattern entirely — none of
  them meet this bar either. This was already tracked as Backlog (`Redesign Figma — Phase 3 : <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim GitHub Projects ticket title, predates the English-only policy -->
  les 10 pages composants + Light/Dark`); this section makes explicit that finishing that <!-- lang-audit-ignore: verbatim GitHub Projects ticket title, predates the English-only policy -->
  ticket is what "done" means for every one of them, not an optional polish pass.

```
✅ A page ships with all 3 frames present, Spec frame's body built to the full §27 structure
✅ "Done" in GitHub Projects requires this — not just a Main-component frame + a tokens table
❌ Never close a component-page ticket with a partial Spec frame content as a placeholder
❌ Never treat the 3-frame shell alone (headers + empty/shortened body) as sufficient
```

### 28.7 Mandatory pre-build verification — inspect the live reference, every piece, every time

> **Rule adopted 2026-08-29**, direct user request, after `badge`'s first `Spec frame` build
> shipped two real defects the user caught by eye that no audit script flagged: (1)
> `section-dos-donts` was hand-built from the pre-Phase-3 `do-column`/`dont-column` pattern
> instead of using the real `doc/dos-donts-card` component, and (2) `Spec frame`'s body was a
> flat list of siblings with exhibits laid out `WRAP` side-by-side, instead of the
> `section-[name]` → `exhibit-stack` (`VERTICAL`) structure `button` actually uses. Both
> defects trace to the same root cause, and it is the same root cause as §28.1's frame-
> positioning incident: **content was built from this document's prose description, or from
> memory of an older page's pattern, instead of from a live inspection of `button`'s actual
> current structure for that specific piece.** §27/§28's prose is a *summary* written after
> the fact — useful for orientation, never a substitute for the live file, which can (and, in
> this exact case, did) diverge from what got written down.

**The rule**: before building any named piece of a component page — a section, a card
pattern, a reusable visual element — do **both** of the following, every time, even for a
piece this document already describes in prose:

```
1. SEARCH ↳ design annotations for an existing doc/* component that matches the pattern
   you're about to build (a card, a badge, a divider, a table row — anything with a
   recognizable shape). Use findAllWithCriteria({types:['COMPONENT','COMPONENT_SET']})
   filtered by name, the same way §28.2/§28.3's doc/frame-header and doc/section-header
   were found. Hand-building a frame that visually resembles an existing doc/* component
   is not a shortcut — it produces something that looks similar and is wrong in the ways
   that matter (wrong icon, wrong border/color source, wrong text-wrapping behavior — see
   §28.4's doc/dos-donts-card gotchas, found only by using the real component).
2. INSPECT the equivalent piece live on `button` (or the current canonical reference page)
   — not this document's description of it — immediately before writing the script that
   builds your version. Pull real node IDs, real layoutMode/itemSpacing/padding values, real
   child names, the same way §28.4's section-* / exhibit-stack structure was reverse-
   engineered. Treat every number and name in §27/§28 as a claim to verify against the live
   file, not a value to copy from this document without checking — this document can go
   stale exactly the way `badge`'s first build went stale against it within the same day.
```

```
✅ Before hand-building any UI pattern: search design-annotations for an existing doc/*
   match first
✅ Before writing the build script for any section: pull that exact section's live structure
   from button first, in the same session, right before writing the code
✅ Treat this document (§27/§28) as an index of what to go verify, not as the source of truth
   itself — the live file is the source of truth, always
❌ Never build a section from memory of an older page's pattern (e.g. the pre-Phase-3
   page-wrapper convention) just because it "looks similar enough" to what's being asked for
❌ Never treat "I read the relevant §27/§28 subsection" as sufficient verification — reading
   the prose is orientation, not the check itself
❌ Never skip this because the piece "seems simple" — the do-column/dont-column mistake was
   exactly this: a simple-looking pattern, confidently rebuilt from memory, silently wrong
```

**Why this isn't caught by `audit-figma-file.js` (§0bis)**: both defects were internally
consistent — every fill was token-bound, every text used a real style, nothing overflowed or
clipped. The audit script checks binding/structural *health*, not *conformance to the
canonical pattern*. A beautifully-built wrong pattern passes every automated check and still
needs a human's eye (or, going forward, the verification step above) to catch.

| Any row (states, instances) overflows the section (content visible on the canvas gray) | `layoutWrap="WRAP"` set without `layoutSizingHorizontal="FILL"` — WRAP is a no-op under HUG | `row.layoutWrap="WRAP"` **+** `row.layoutSizingHorizontal="FILL"` **+** `counterAxisSpacing` — see §17 |
| Duplicated content (e.g. links) visible twice on the same page | `links-row` added to both `section-header` and `section-links` | Only one `links-row`, in `section-links` alone (bottom of page) — see §10 |
| Fill/stroke bound to `semantic/...` when a component token exists | Habit of binding the semantic token without checking `component/<comp>/...` first | Always look for the matching `component/` token before binding — see §18 |
| `textStyleId` reverts to `""` after appearing to apply | `fontName`/`setRangeFontName` set after `textStyleId` — the API clears the link, unlike the Figma editor | Never mutate the font after `textStyleId`; if the weight doesn't match, create/use the right Text Style — see §19 |
| Icon overflows its slot (18×18) when resized or swapped via instance-swap | The icon's internal `Frame` wrapper is at `constraints: MIN/MIN` (the `createNodeFromSvg` default) — doesn't follow the parent instance's resize | `frame.constraints = { horizontal:'SCALE', vertical:'SCALE' }` at EVERY intermediate level, not just the final `Vector` nodes — see §20 |
| Wrapped text renders lines stacked on top of each other (self-overlap or overlapping the row above) | Text Style `lineHeight` bound as `{unit:"PIXELS", value:1.6}` instead of `{unit:"PERCENT", value:160}` | Audit every Text Style's `lineHeight.unit` — see §26.1 |
| Content spills onto the plain page background instead of staying on its "card"/section background | Background is a sibling frame at a manually-matched size, not a real parent — drifts the moment content grows | `appendChild` content into the background, set the background to auto-layout HUG — see §26.2 |
| A row of sample bars/badges doesn't align to a common starting X across rows | The preceding text/description column is `FILL`/`layoutGrow=1`, pushing the bar to the row's right edge | Give that column a `FIXED` width sized to the longest row's content — see §26.3 |
| `node.height` / `.absoluteBoundingBox` reads a nonsensical tiny value (e.g. `1`) right after a mutation | Stale auto-layout geometry cache in the Plugin API, not a real layout state | Read `.absoluteRenderBounds` instead, or re-fetch the node in a fresh `use_figma` call — see §26.4 |
| A page has multiple live content sections loose at the top level (canvas gray, §13, visible between/around them) | Sections were `page.appendChild()`-ed directly to the page instead of into a single `page-wrapper` — no enclosing container at all, not just a width mismatch | Create ONE `page-wrapper` (1440px), move every live section into it as a child; run `findMissingWrapper()` — see §26.11 |
| A `FIXED`-width `TEXT` child overflows its parent after the parent was resized, and `.resize()`/`.resizeWithoutConstraints()` on that child silently do nothing (no error, width unchanged even on a fresh re-read) | The child is `layoutSizingHorizontal: 'FIXED'` inside an auto-layout instance — the Plugin API doesn't apply a literal-width resize to it | Set `textNode.layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` instead of resizing — see §26.12 |
| Text is technically visible but fails contrast / was clearly hand-picked | `fills[0].boundVariables` is empty — a hardcoded color, not a token | Bind to the matching semantic token and compute WCAG contrast — see §26.5 |
